1
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:40,802
Mom.

2
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:51,579
The wreath fell again.

3
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,583
Okay. I thought
I saw something.

4
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,385
Okay.

5
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,488
What are you reading?

6
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,159
Green Lantern.

7
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,262
It's Earth's branch of the
intergalactic police force.

8
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,032
Makes things
happen with his mind.

9
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,637
Well, his ring.
But it's mostly his mind.

10
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:19,206
Yeah.

11
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,110
Maybe they
should write a comic

12
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,745
about a middle-aged
Louisville nurse

13
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,447
whose pheromones cause
men to lose their minds.

14
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:29,216
I'd read that.

15
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,284
What? Humor me.

16
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,354
The level to which I humor
you is already off the charts.

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,394
Please just eat your toast.

18
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,668
All right, we
should take your temp.

19
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,402
This isn't a cartoon.

20
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,672
My temperature doesn't
go up when I get mad.

21
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:53,273
You're mad?

22
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:14,327
I can't,
can't keep this up.

23
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,098
I know it's hard.

24
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:23,336
We both just have to be
strong just until it breaks.

25
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,608
Me or the blizzard?

26
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,755
You behave out there.

27
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,181
So'd you ever start your
graphic novel thingy?

28
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,087
Well, I sat down to draw it
and I was like, "Oh shit,

29
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,990
I should probably come
up with a story first."

30
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,627
A grand opening, grand closing.

31
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:18,032
Well, I'm sure
you have some ideas.

32
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,968
I wanna write something dark.

33
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:27,441
Something karmic, but
engaging and hopeful, too.

34
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,776
I, I don't know.

35
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,078
Well, I could help.

36
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:38,753
Hey!

37
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,956
I'll autograph one for
you when I'm done, okay?

38
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,759
Just gimme some space.

39
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,161
Okay.

40
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,167
There is something you
could do that might help.

41
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,072
Tell me the worst
thing you've ever done.

42
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:01,642
Well, that's a bit direct.

43
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,877
Before you had me.

44
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,455
I don't,

45
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:17,058
I don't wanna tell you.

46
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,962
Wouldn't be that
useful if you did.

47
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:27,635
Well...

48
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,574
the people and the
places are a b-, a blur,

49
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:35,943
but I remember

50
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,115
I was a bad person.

51
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:44,218
You? Or the drugs?

52
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,854
I'm glad that you can
make the distinction

53
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:50,825
between the two,
but no, it was me.

54
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:59,500
I, I enjoyed
corrupting innocence,

55
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:05,473
mm, you know, giving them
a taste of the darkness

56
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,241
that flowed through my veins.

57
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,778
It was, it was worse than
misery loving company.

58
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:15,116
It was, it was chaos
making chaos for breakfast.

59
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,119
Mm.

60
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:22,990
20 years ago, right?
Ancient history.

61
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:27,761
Mm. No, you don't just
click your heels and run...

62
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:32,032
Have a pass waiting for
you like that in the dark.

63
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,670
Or outside the window.

64
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,812
Mm, chaos making
chaos for breakfast.

65
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,318
The past is a bitch like that.

66
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,292
At least you
didn't kill anybody.

67
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:03,097
Not like you're
gonna kill me.

68
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:28,155
That is not the most accurate.

69
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,857
My asshole's frozen shut.

70
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,300
I think I stacked
the dishes funny.

71
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,101
Dry off. I'll be right back.

72
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,796
Look at all the decorations.

73
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,599
They have decorations. I
hope there's no kids here.

74
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,866
What?

75
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:46,900
Well, I don't
wanna freak them out.

76
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,503
I don't wanna freak anybody out!

77
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,104
Come here.

78
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:53,575
Kory?

79
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:54,908
-Yeah?
-This doesn't feel right.

80
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,011
No, Lizzie,
it feels warm.

81
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:58,379
Look, we need to go!

82
00:12:58,613 --> 00:12:59,648
Where?

83
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,752
Run!

84
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:04,918
Get out of my house!

85
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:13,927
What the?

86
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,665
-Stop! Stop!
-Wait! Wait!

87
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,034
Okay, wait? Just
wait a second, okay?

88
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,070
We're not here to hurt anybody.

89
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,706
We, we just wanted
to get out of the cold.

90
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:25,740
Bullshit!

91
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,408
I'm sorry, okay?
This was a mistake.

92
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,442
-Yeah!
-Yeah, I told you that

93
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,077
10 fucking minutes ago.

94
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:32,946
I need a doctor. Hey, lady,
are you a nurse or something?

95
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,583
No, and you need to get
the hell out of here now.

96
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,085
But ma'am, it
is freezing outside.

97
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,654
I can't walk.
I'm fucking dying.

98
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:40,988
You're not dying.

99
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,990
You have to help me.
That's a rule, isn't it, right?

100
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,825
It's like the, the, uh, what
is it, the Hippocratic Oath?

101
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,193
-What are you-
-No, that's doctors.

102
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,494
Nurses take the
Nightingale Pledge.

103
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:48,663
Oh, I'm sorry.

104
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,164
Hey, that doesn't cover
home fucking invasion.

105
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,965
Okay, we can debate
that while he bleeds

106
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,033
all over your floor.

107
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,469
There'll be more damages
than we meant to cause.

108
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,973
Do you know what'll happen
if you send us out there?

109
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,043
I'm not sure I'd be able
to live with myself.

110
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,346
But your house, your call.

111
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,116
Please, please.

112
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:14,756
Dammit. Help me
get him to the couch.

113
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,791
-Breathe, just breathe.
-Okay.

114
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:17,759
-I'm breathing!
-Little faster.

115
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,126
I think I'm hyperventilating.

116
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,260
I'm gonna fucking pass out now.

117
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,530
-Ow, fuck, come on!
-Ooh, sorry,

118
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,132
-sorry, sorry!
-Ow! Oh, fuck.

119
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,503
Ooh, okay, rags.

120
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:29,704
-Huh?
-In the kitchen

121
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,105
underneath the sink!

122
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,174
Ah, okay, I'm ready.
Just, just, just yank it.

123
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,909
Yeah, it's not
gonna be that simple.

124
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,177
What?

125
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:41,716
What is that?

126
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,652
No, no, no, no, no
tools, no, no. It's okay.

127
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,688
Trust me, this is the easy way.

128
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,422
Uh, what do I do?

129
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,024
Roll it up and
put it in his mouth.

130
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,126
Okay.

131
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,862
Hell of a time to
be out for a stroll.

132
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,063
Blizzard's been full tilt
for the past six days.

133
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,898
Yeah, I told her that this
little missionary trip

134
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:58,932
could wait till spring.

135
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,100
-This isn't-
-Well 'tis the season.

136
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,637
All right.
Hold the bat still.

137
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:04,037
There's gonna be
more blood coming.

138
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,174
Here we go.

139
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,042
All right.

140
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,112
Oh, shit! Sorry!

141
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,648
What the fuck, man?

142
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:14,982
I'm sorry.

143
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,085
I'm sorry. Are you ready

144
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:18,986
No!

145
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,297
-Okay.
-Just you here?

146
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,133
I have a daughter.

147
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,670
She has a fever.

148
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,939
Is that her room at the door?

149
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,276
She's not a basket
case or something?

150
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:50,384
Apply pressure.
Do not leave this room.

151
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:17,444
Charm?

152
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:37,866
Charm.

153
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,434
You hammer,
I'll see to his knee,

154
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,135
and we'll figure
out the rest later.

155
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,757
Nice house. Must be
one heck of a nurse.

156
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,026
I had a hospice patient.

157
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,359
We worked together
for two years.

158
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,327
I didn't think she
liked me very much,

159
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:24,197
but she went, her will came,

160
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,667
it was hers, and now it's mine.

161
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,236
Thanks.

162
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,807
Guest room.
It's yours for the night.

163
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,647
Does that make you feel safe?

164
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:46,253
Yeah, absolutely. What
makes you feel safe?

165
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,924
Big bats with screws in them.

166
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:56,196
So what's your daughter's deal?

167
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,867
I told you. She has a fever.

168
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,936
Yeah, it must be pretty bad.

169
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:03,236
And all the metal.

170
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,007
She's prone to
psychotic episodes.

171
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,241
I'd insist that you stay away.

172
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,714
You're the boss, Nightingale.

173
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,247
Yeah.

174
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,623
Thanks again.

175
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:27,929
I heard voices.

176
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,798
Are there really
people down there?

177
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:33,034
Uh, yeah, they just,
they got caught in the storm,

178
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,737
so it's just gonna
be for a few hours.

179
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,740
I could get dressed, say hi.

180
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,209
You know that's not a good idea.

181
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:46,714
I just, I just wanna
talk to somebody.

182
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,684
Charm, these people, they're,
they're drifters, okay?

183
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,451
The 8 ball they did in
the shelter's probably

184
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,821
the only reason why
they're not frozen solid.

185
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,490
You would know.

186
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:58,893
I would fucking know!

187
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:06,968
Can you just trust
me for once? Please?

188
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,316
2.4 degrees.

189
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,954
That's all that's keeping her
from slipping away from me.

190
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:28,790
Again.

191
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:35,029
I know addiction,
I know sickness,

192
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:42,703
but what has Charm is
a biological nightmare,

193
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,741
and I'm fighting it the
only way that I know how,

194
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,349
but that, that safe
zone, that coveted window

195
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:59,419
is getting harder and
harder to maintain.

196
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:09,831
I'm so tired and my
sweet, sweet girl, she is

197
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:14,135
running out of time.

198
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,869
We got lucky.

199
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:49,402
Wasn't luck.

200
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:50,972
Yeah, no, I know it.

201
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,472
I'm just, you know what I mean.

202
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,375
You mean we found the house
at the end of the rainbow

203
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,011
like the leprechaun
said we would?

204
00:22:57,545 --> 00:22:59,013
Oh, look under the cushion.

205
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,083
Maybe there's some gold coins
sprinkled about, laddie.

206
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,517
I get it already.

207
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,219
And credit where it's due, huh?

208
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:06,988
No, just saying

209
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:10,224
that this is an extremely
fortunate situation.

210
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,927
Found a nice warm
house with the power on

211
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:17,464
and the hostess is a nurse among
other bucket-list fetishes.

212
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,433
That was a joke, Liz.

213
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,435
But I
tell you that anyone

214
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,038
who looks at a woman lustfully

215
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:27,508
has already committed adultery
with her in his heart.

216
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:31,746
Liz, I'm not married.

217
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:40,021
I'm sorry. I'm in your
corner no matter what.

218
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:46,527
We just can't have
another misunderstanding.

219
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:49,764
Okay.

220
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,198
Not now.

221
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:59,874
So what are you
looking for exactly?

222
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:01,474
Intracranial hemorrhaging.

223
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:04,078
It's a possible side effect
from a prolonged fever.

224
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,214
So brain damage.

225
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:10,051
It's just a precaution.

226
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:13,554
Heavy recovery from any
medication has a mini withdrawal

227
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,556
Psychosis is a possibility.

228
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:16,991
Auditory and visual
hallucinations,

229
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:21,028
lucid sleepwalking,
but you'll be fine.

230
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:31,572
When you said you made mistakes
before, was I one of them?

231
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:39,547
I've made mistakes before you,

232
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:43,150
after you, with you,

233
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,722
but never you.

234
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:55,129
So who are they downstairs?

235
00:24:56,864 --> 00:25:01,502
Um, they're just some kids
who got caught in the storm.

236
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:02,703
Kids?

237
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,972
Well, no, no, they're adults.

238
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:06,807
Well, you just said kids.

239
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:07,975
Okay, it's a figure of speech.

240
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,577
Which is the exact
opposite of adults.

241
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:10,311
Why are you pushing me?

242
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,512
I'm not pushing you.

243
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,080
I just wanna have some
normal interaction with-

244
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:15,082
Well, you're not normal!

245
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,758
You're more, Charm.

246
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,893
You're more, okay?

247
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,030
You're more than anyone
could ever understand.

248
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:31,866
And what's happening right now

249
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:34,802
leads away from logic
into pure phenomena,

250
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,805
so it, it, it
doesn't make it easier.

251
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:41,642
It makes it harder.

252
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:47,681
I promise I won't
give up if you don't,

253
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,950
but you have to trust me.

254
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,328
All right. Maybe a quick dinner.

255
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:10,137
What are those? Those aren't
what you normally, um...

256
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:14,041
Dinner or not, kiddo?

257
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,691
Okay. Well, I will
leave the door unlocked.

258
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,293
Come down in about 20 minutes.

259
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,657
Oh, come on man. You're
gotta say something.

260
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:38,726
She's gonna think you're
a fucking serial killer.

261
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:42,129
Um, hey, going hiking?

262
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:51,005
Who are you now?

263
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,806
Our little home invader?

264
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:55,009
Yeah. Yep, that's me, Kory.

265
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:57,945
Sorry, um, uh, it, it, it, just,

266
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:00,181
I'm not, I'm not
dangerous, okay.

267
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:02,249
Said every serial killer ever.

268
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,785
Okay, please, please
don't. Please don't scream.

269
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:05,554
Liz will freak out and then-

270
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,820
Liz?

271
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:09,123
Yeah, that's my sister who
thinks she is my mother.

272
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,325
You know, I love her,
I, I, it's just like,

273
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,395
don't you wish people would
back the fuck off sometimes?

274
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:18,165
All the time.
You coming out or what?

275
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:22,069
Uh, I was sort of
thinking I'd stay here

276
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:24,305
because, uh,
if you don't see me,

277
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:27,676
then we got a little bit of,
uh, uh, plausible deniability,

278
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:28,909
you know what I mean?

279
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:39,286
So you're pretty
into porcupines, huh?

280
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,156
I hate them.

281
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,160
Oh, yeah, sure.
That explains the shrine.

282
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:47,928
It's hard to exert
control over something

283
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:50,197
when you're too
busy running from it.

284
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:53,000
Sounds like you got
some adult concerns.

285
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,170
Yeah, I'm
juggling a few others.

286
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,439
Oh, yeah. Like what?

287
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:03,377
Like the effect antifreeze
has on one's innards.

288
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:11,218
Did you know porcupine
means pig with swords?

289
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:15,055
Did you know their quills
are basically calcified hair?

290
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:16,290
I did not.

291
00:29:16,357 --> 00:29:18,259
And that at the right angle
they sink into the flesh,

292
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:19,728
like hot rebar.

293
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,997
How did
you find that out?

294
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:26,834
The hard way.

295
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:32,139
My mom had surprised me
with a trip to the zoo.

296
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:35,776
Like always, she felt bad

297
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,444
and thought this would
make everything okay.

298
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:42,116
You wanna take it
outta my pocket?

299
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:43,150
-Yeah, I do!
-But even then

300
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,753
I could see
through her bullshit.

301
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:46,521
Where is it, huh?
What you gonna do with it?

302
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:48,723
What are you gonna do with
it? Better give it on back!

303
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,958
-The look in her eye.
-Who you gonna sell it to?

304
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,259
It was
more than hunger.

305
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:56,163
It was, it scared me,

306
00:29:58,365 --> 00:29:59,133
so I ran.

307
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,542
There were people everywhere,
but no one helped.

308
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:17,918
Ran through the first
door I could find,

309
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:22,256
the wrong one.

310
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,058
Mama, Mama, Mama.

311
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:25,760
The smell hit me first.

312
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:30,130
Then I, I saw it.

313
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:40,207
Possession, negligence. They
arrested her on the spot.

314
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,677
How long did they keep her?

315
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:47,881
She kept herself. 7
rehab stints in 10 years.

316
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,920
But, but she's, uh, she's all
better now, though, right?

317
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:56,256
Like she's, uh,
rehabilitated or whatever.

318
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,160
Part of recovering
is letting go.

319
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:03,263
She has this old suitcase

320
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,399
from her party days
out in the garage.

321
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:07,267
Probably still something

322
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:10,037
in there to make
all the pain go away.

323
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,940
Guess all that shit with
your mom is the reason

324
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:15,275
you got the whole tortured
artist thing going on, right?

325
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:17,612
I mean, well,
I mean almost anyway, right?

326
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,646
What do you mean?

327
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:20,114
I don't know, I mean, um,

328
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,618
no obsession is complete
without a cool origin story, so.

329
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,555
Some battle scars might have
sold it better. That's all.

330
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:48,375
Honey
are you coming down?

331
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:51,412
Guess it's showtime.

332
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:53,548
Yeah, yeah,
I guess I better, um...

333
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:55,215
Escape?

334
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,686
No one's getting
out of this zoo.

335
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,376
What? Okay.

336
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:28,148
-Pass that.
-Oh, thank you.

337
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:29,283
Thanks.

338
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:30,585
Smells great, ma'am.

339
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,395
Hi, Charm. Uh, this is
Liz and that's Kory.

340
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:48,503
Uh, we appreciate
your hospitality.

341
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:51,739
We'll see.

342
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,377
Uh, before we start eating,

343
00:32:57,444 --> 00:33:00,548
I would be honored to
lead us in a blessing.

344
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:02,082
If we could all join hands?

345
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:12,025
Heavenly Father, thank you
for leading us out of the cold

346
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:14,796
and into the limitless
warmth of Your love.

347
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:18,499
Please bless our food,
but especially our host,

348
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:21,168
hostesses who have graced us

349
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:23,505
with an all-too-rare compassion.

350
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:25,840
In Your name, we say

351
00:33:25,907 --> 00:33:27,207
amen.

352
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,347
Let's eat.

353
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:36,350
So we're making tracks along
the road outside Shelby Bowl,

354
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,719
and then the snow just
starts dumping on us.

355
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:40,722
Mm-hmm, and we need shelter,
but we wanna keep moving.

356
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:42,189
-Bus, right?
-Wrong.

357
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:44,124
Some kind human
took it upon themselves

358
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,326
to knock down every
stop marker for like-

359
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:47,962
For like, it's
like two miles easy.

360
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,196
So the buses are going by us

361
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:50,532
and we're screaming
bloody murder.

362
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:54,034
Yeah, for hours, so then
I gave up and I sat down-

363
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,402
In the snow.

364
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:56,436
And I cried.

365
00:33:56,504 --> 00:33:57,539
Yes, you did.

366
00:33:57,672 --> 00:34:00,374
Mm, why didn't you just pray

367
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,677
for the limitless
warmth of His love?

368
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:10,652
Uh, I did that, too.

369
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,052
Well, help me understand.

370
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,320
Like, maybe you can
explain it to me.

371
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,357
So when you have food
right, you thank Him for it,

372
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:20,895
but when you are trapped
in sub-zero temperatures,

373
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:22,830
that's a sign, right?

374
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:24,933
A sign of what?

375
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:27,067
That God wants you
to freeze to death.

376
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:31,673
I don't think God wants
anyone to freeze to death.

377
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:37,411
I think God uses the cold
like a farmer would use

378
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:41,481
an electric fence to steer
you to where you belong.

379
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:44,519
Okay, so say God
steers you here

380
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:47,822
and I send you right back out
the window that you came in,

381
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:52,492
and then, you know,
something bad happens.

382
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:54,127
Who's the guilty party?

383
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,330
The party that feels guilty.

384
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,398
I don't know.

385
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,635
Doesn't His plan kind of
give me an out, though?

386
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:03,136
Like, no repercussions,
cause like, whatever I do,

387
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:07,508
whatever happens,
it's His plan, right?

388
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:13,113
Well, God...

389
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:15,850
Have you ever heard
of the term PBAB?

390
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:18,586
Pine box at bedside?

391
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:24,025
Yeah, I've been a
nurse for 10 years now,

392
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:25,392
and I've helped more
people evade death

393
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,327
than you could even fathom,

394
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:29,463
and it wasn't because I
waited for holy intervention

395
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,198
or because I
trusted in the plan.

396
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:34,334
I acted. The use of
science is an act.

397
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:37,204
And the people who believe
in the myth to save them,

398
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:40,508
they build those pine boxes
and the people who act,

399
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,275
we keep them empty.

400
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:49,917
I think one day
you're gonna wonder

401
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,552
what else you are wrong about.

402
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,423
Emerald twilight.

403
00:35:58,425 --> 00:35:59,027
What?

404
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:02,195
Oh, Mom, you're gonna love this.

405
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,298
Hal Jordan, Earth's
Green Lantern, uh,

406
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,335
he comes back from this cosmic
ass-kicking marathon, right?

407
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,272
And he finds his home, Coast
City, completely annihilated.

408
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:17,578
Everything he ever loved or
held dear is just a crater.

409
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:23,818
So he's devastated
and he gets an idea.

410
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:29,023
He uses his ring to
resurrect Coast City.

411
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,960
All the buildings are back
and people stroll the streets,

412
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:36,263
holding hands and
sharing embraces

413
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,397
with the one who got away.

414
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,399
He even spends time
with his dead mother

415
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,838
till his ring runs out of power.

416
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:47,008
So he shoots up into space to
get back to his home planet

417
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:51,713
where their,
where their power source is,

418
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,048
and he needs it.

419
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:56,651
He needs all of it to
keep Coast City alive,

420
00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:58,853
but the, the Guardians
and the other Lanterns,

421
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,990
they won't let him have it,
so he obliterates them all.

422
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:07,028
Charm. Charm?

423
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:10,631
No one feels guilty if
they're destroying something

424
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:11,866
in order to build.

425
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:18,438
Not God, not superheroes,
not fucking politicians.

426
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:25,780
But I think we should.

427
00:37:26,214 --> 00:37:27,782
I, I think.

428
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,186
Charm. Charm!

429
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:33,755
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Charm!

430
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:35,656
Oh my god, this is a
seizure. What do we do?

431
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:37,290
Can't just stand here.
We gotta do something.

432
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:38,593
Help me lie her straight.

433
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:39,927
No, you're supposed to put
something in her mouth.

434
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:41,162
What, are you a doctor now?

435
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:42,663
She's gonna fucking die, man!

436
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:46,399
Shit. The power transfer switch.

437
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,536
Oh great, the power transfer
switch. That's lovely.

438
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:49,269
Calm down!

439
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:50,671
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

440
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:52,907
We can't see shit and there's
a girl dying on the floor.

441
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:53,875
I apologize for losing my zen.

442
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:54,776
-Okay.
-You, you have

443
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:56,343
like a, a backup
generator or something?

444
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:57,745
No, it should have kicked on.

445
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:58,946
Flashlights?

446
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:04,384
Yes, there is a backup jenny
in the corner of the garage.

447
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:06,286
All right, you guys take these.

448
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:06,988
Go turn the switch on.

449
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:08,122
What, why us?

450
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:09,289
We don't know anything
about generators.

451
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:10,357
Because I need to be
here with my daughter.

452
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:11,793
Um, okay, he, he, he's right.

453
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,261
Okay, we don't know
what we're doing,

454
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:15,696
so why don't you take him
and I'll stay with her.

455
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:22,970
Okay, let's go.

456
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:24,972
After this, team meeting.

457
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:34,515
Uh, okay, just um,
stay there.

458
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,257
S- so, uh, Charm's dad,

459
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,425
is he, is he in the picture?

460
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,762
I cut him out a long time ago.

461
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:49,396
Doesn't stop him
from squirming in

462
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:50,698
every now and then, but...

463
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:56,637
Shit. Can you
give me some light?

464
00:38:57,238 --> 00:38:59,941
Uh-huh.

465
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:03,110
You know, I think the
whole body positivity thing

466
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:04,812
is super hot.

467
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:28,102
Hello? Charm?

468
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:43,885
Are you all right?

469
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:49,456
Like, if you need help,

470
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:55,963
if something's wrong,
like, really wrong,

471
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,835
you just have to tell me.

472
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:15,242
Charm?

473
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,417
Help me, Mama.

474
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:27,855
O- okay, just, just, just
wait a second! You guys!

475
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,135
Team meeting, all right.

476
00:42:05,393 --> 00:42:06,627
Charm?

477
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:21,776
Charm? Can you follow my voice?

478
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:25,246
Can you follow my voice?

479
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:34,588
I'll go as far as I can, but
you're gonna have to meet me.

480
00:42:37,725 --> 00:42:39,927
Charm, are you coming?

481
00:42:57,078 --> 00:43:00,714
Our Father Who art in
heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

482
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:03,350
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

483
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,296
Charm?

484
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:21,769
Hello?

485
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,456
Hurry, open this door!

486
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,725
Hurry, open the fucking door!

487
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:48,929
Somebody open this door!

488
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:51,932
We got you. Hey, hey.

489
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:53,100
Oh no.

490
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,338
There is, there
is something out there.

491
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:58,739
-What?
-Okay, maybe there is.

492
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:01,642
There's a tunnel all the way
to your damn mailbox, okay?

493
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:04,011
-Come here, come here.
-well, where's Charm?

494
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:06,113
-Something was chasing me.
-Charm. Charm.

495
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,086
Ice tunnel?

496
00:44:12,153 --> 00:44:14,088
Yes. Go look, I swear!

497
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,091
What the fuck?

498
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,306
Something is wrong here.
Have you been seeing things.

499
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:33,941
With all the pills
I've been taking,

500
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,376
I don't think I'm
seeing enough things.

501
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:36,410
Look, I'm being serious!

502
00:44:36,477 --> 00:44:37,845
Yeah, and I'm
being logical, dude.

503
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:41,650
Like, we're all tired and
hungry and fucking horny, okay?

504
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:44,218
So I think some minor
freakouts are allowed.

505
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,054
She drugged us.

506
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:48,088
What?

507
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:51,560
I was fine until we ate
and then, and then I, I,

508
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:52,993
-I thought I saw.
-Oh, no, no, no.

509
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,361
I ate the same thing you did.

510
00:44:54,596 --> 00:44:55,863
Maybe it's too
busy bouncing off

511
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,398
all the other crap
in your system.

512
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:58,633
Yeah, and maybe
it's like the time

513
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,901
you saw St. Anthony
in the shower.

514
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:02,803
Look, you want me to
concur with something?

515
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,973
I'll concur that Charm is a
few bats short of a belfry.

516
00:45:06,508 --> 00:45:09,109
Or is it too many bats?
It's too many bats, right?

517
00:45:10,077 --> 00:45:11,312
I think she's here
against her will.

518
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:15,316
The, the seizures, the
door. It, it makes sense.

519
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:16,283
No, it do-

520
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,385
I, I talked to her, okay.

521
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:21,956
She would've told me if she
was a, like a fucking hostage.

522
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:25,926
It's my face. Makes
girls wanna open up.

523
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:29,496
-Ugh.
-Don't. Hey, don't, okay?

524
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:31,666
Your neurotic hunch
is gonna put us

525
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:33,100
in a freeze-to-death situation.

526
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:37,505
So you would ignore a
captive human to stay warm?

527
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:40,040
I am disabled.

528
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:46,847
Just get some
rest, okay, Nancy Drew?

529
00:45:47,147 --> 00:45:50,484
We're hitting the slopes
tomorrow, no skis.

530
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:55,389
You know, when
they delivered you,

531
00:45:56,625 --> 00:46:00,629
both of your lungs collapsed,
and the umbilical cord

532
00:46:00,695 --> 00:46:02,263
wrapped around your
neck was not helping.

533
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,199
You weighed two pounds.

534
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:09,336
When they tried to check you
out in the corner of the room,

535
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:10,505
the power died,

536
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,376
and I didn't know
what was happening.

537
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:18,580
You know, I was so
disoriented from the drugs,

538
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:19,913
theirs and my own.

539
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:21,616
I didn't know what was going on,

540
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:23,150
but I could hear them talking

541
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:26,153
and they were talking about
you like you were already dead.

542
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,524
And I knew that I
couldn't be there for you,

543
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:33,060
that you would have to
be your own battery,

544
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:36,196
your own safety, your own charm,

545
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:41,636
but this time, this time,

546
00:46:41,703 --> 00:46:43,772
I'm here to pull
you out of the dark.

547
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,099
The substitute compound is
making her more aggressive.

548
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:18,807
I might have to,
I might have to. Fuck!

549
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:25,145
Fuck.

550
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:30,618
Fuck.

551
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:12,259
Hello.

552
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:18,098
Uh, uh, fuck.

553
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,672
Just leave you there.

554
00:48:25,774 --> 00:48:30,144
Um, um, um.

555
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:34,582
Oh, Jesus, you're the man.

556
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:45,192
What the fuck?

557
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:49,163
Jesus Christ, Faith.

558
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:52,667
What?

559
00:48:54,702 --> 00:48:56,704
Make the pain go away, my ass.

560
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:04,411
Idiot.

561
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:19,393
Mine now.

562
00:49:35,342 --> 00:49:36,310
Okay.

563
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,749
Shit, I got it.

564
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:10,912
Sorry.

565
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:54,622
Some, uh,

566
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:55,690
it's a crazy day, huh?

567
00:50:56,624 --> 00:50:59,393
Still early,
isn't it, buddy?

568
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:02,931
Oh, oh, uh, you're, um.

569
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:07,434
Charm's father,
man of the house. That's me.

570
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:11,005
She didn't really, uh, she
didn't really mention you.

571
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:15,610
Really? Sounds like
sour teenage grapes to me.

572
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,111
Well, I wouldn't know

573
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:19,847
I, um, I don't have any kids.

574
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:21,683
Not yet,
but you got plenty

575
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:25,019
of that pure white venom
just itching to get out.

576
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:27,989
I can
smell it from here.

577
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:16,169
You know, I never
apologized t-, um,

578
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:18,706
to you for sort of
just dropping in here.

579
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:19,741
So sorry.

580
00:52:30,852 --> 00:52:34,856
I should go back to bed. So,
um, sorry to wake you up here.

581
00:52:35,523 --> 00:52:36,490
Kory.

582
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:40,227
Yeah?

583
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:45,767
You've got
something of mine.

584
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:49,436
I'm sorry. I, I wasn't gonna.

585
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:03,818
Nighty-night.

586
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,761
What the fuck?

587
00:53:18,032 --> 00:53:19,399
Don't go out there.

588
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:21,169
I have to see her for myself.

589
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:23,203
Trust me, hey. It's not safe.

590
00:53:23,437 --> 00:53:24,706
Well, maybe she's
not safe, either.

591
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:26,339
Who fucking cares?

592
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:29,342
That sickening lack of
empathy for your fellow man

593
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,344
is gonna come for
you tenfold, brother,

594
00:53:31,445 --> 00:53:34,716
so do yourself a favour
and get with the program

595
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,150
before it's too late.

596
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:36,918
Move.

597
00:55:06,207 --> 00:55:07,542
Charm?

598
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:13,881
It's me, Liz.

599
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,753
Yeah, I know where you are.

600
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:21,522
Come to stare at
the basket case?

601
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:27,028
Old school. Nice.

602
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:31,833
Literally been in
hundreds of those things,

603
00:55:31,899 --> 00:55:33,968
but I still don't
understand how they work.

604
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:37,370
Photo chemicals are basically
popped like a pimple

605
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:40,141
onto a positive sheet
when the exposure exits.

606
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:43,044
After that,
what you see is what you get

607
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:46,914
or what you thought you saw.

608
00:55:48,716 --> 00:55:52,820
Mystery solved.
I brought you these.

609
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:59,660
Th- they're very striking.
Thought you might want them.

610
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:03,965
Liz, right?

611
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:12,073
Last time I checked, there's
only one copy of that key.

612
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:17,111
I had to see for myself.

613
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:18,411
See what for yourself?

614
00:56:18,746 --> 00:56:21,082
That you weren't
here against your will.

615
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:26,554
The seizure, the door,
the, the, the tunnel.

616
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:29,824
The tunnel.

617
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,628
Take my picture.

618
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:40,768
Your home is odd.

619
00:56:42,435 --> 00:56:44,071
I've been keeping my eyes open.

620
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:47,474
Usually there'll
be a sign somewhere.

621
00:56:48,209 --> 00:56:51,612
You know, a trinket, a symbol.

622
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:53,446
Some evidence of-

623
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:54,348
Evidence of what?

624
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:02,890
Faith.

625
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:11,532
Hmm. Value judgements from
the home invader, hmm?

626
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:14,201
I'm sorry. I just...

627
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:20,708
I- is there something

628
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:25,212
that you wanna tell me
about your mother?

629
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:31,118
I've seen situations
like this before.

630
00:57:31,886 --> 00:57:34,922
This isn't how real
protection works.

631
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:38,859
What's there to tell?

632
00:57:40,895 --> 00:57:42,563
My mom thinks I
turn into a monster

633
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,565
if I get too hot or too cold.

634
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:47,835
Well, do you?

635
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:51,806
Joking.

636
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:58,379
I really, your mother seemed
to have this overdeveloped

637
00:57:58,446 --> 00:58:01,849
sense of duty when it
comes to your health.

638
00:58:03,217 --> 00:58:07,521
Sometimes people want us to
think that their transgressions

639
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:09,757
are powered by passion.

640
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:13,761
Then what's actually
in the tank, hmm?

641
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:19,233
I don't know. Guilt, maybe.

642
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:24,572
You two sure seem
fascinated by the G word.

643
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:27,708
I just wish we agreed
on its functions.

644
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:31,679
Guilt is a stain
bestowed upon people

645
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:34,548
who make the wrong decisions.

646
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:39,854
It's the whole point. It's
what separates us from beasts.

647
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:48,295
So if I really am a monster,

648
00:58:49,563 --> 00:58:52,033
my mom shouldn't feel
guilty for locking me up,

649
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:58,939
tranquilized like a beast?

650
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:07,081
Charm, I've seen monsters.

651
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:11,252
You're not one of them.

652
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:26,333
Charm.

653
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,335
What you see is what you get.

654
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:45,086
That's, that's enough.

655
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:04,905
Charm!

656
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:26,627
Charm!

657
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:55,456
Hey, I don't know
what just happened.

658
01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:00,694
You don't have to tell me. But,
um, we obviously have to go.

659
01:01:13,642 --> 01:01:15,176
I don't know what
the fuck that is.

660
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:16,611
Look.

661
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:24,818
Listen, we're gonna get,

662
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:26,187
we're gonna get some blankets

663
01:01:26,253 --> 01:01:28,189
and then we're gonna steal
some food and then we go out

664
01:01:28,255 --> 01:01:30,592
the way we came in and we
just move faster than shit.

665
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:34,461
I can't. We can't.

666
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:37,398
Hey, Lizzie. Hey,
hey, hey, Lizzie.

667
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:39,833
I know you think you
can help these people.

668
01:01:40,134 --> 01:01:42,469
That's why you're,
you're amazing.

669
01:01:43,938 --> 01:01:46,173
Whatever's happening
in this house is so big

670
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,610
and dark that even a
fucking idiot like me

671
01:01:48,677 --> 01:01:50,311
knows you cannot pray it away.

672
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:51,412
We're all she has.

673
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:54,348
Fuck, no, Liz! Pack your shit.

674
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:59,119
Lizzie, I'll leave you.

675
01:02:02,957 --> 01:02:06,794
Turning our back on
her would be a sin

676
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,029
that dwarves all others.

677
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:16,036
What do you wanna do?

678
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:26,313
I wanna vanquish the demon.

679
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,489
The substitute compound is
making her more aggressive.

680
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:43,831
I might have to,
I might have to. Fuck!

681
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:50,705
Every medicinal compound
ever created is just a litany

682
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:53,474
of chemicals that either
trigger, inhibit,

683
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:56,578
or neutralize until the
desired effect is reached.

684
01:02:57,111 --> 01:03:00,447
There's no precedent
for what we face,

685
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:05,587
and this holding pattern
is becoming more harmful

686
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:07,821
to her than the real thing.

687
01:03:13,327 --> 01:03:14,562
The real thing.

688
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:26,641
Maybe just a micro dose
to get us through the storm.

689
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:48,530
Hey, Faith. Hey.

690
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:50,831
What is going on?

691
01:03:50,898 --> 01:03:51,832
Nothing.

692
01:03:51,899 --> 01:03:54,034
-Hmm?
-Yeah, I, I swear.

693
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:54,968
You swear.

694
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:57,404
I thought you Jesus freaks
weren't supposed to do that.

695
01:03:57,471 --> 01:04:00,207
Well, I'm kind of a failure
of being a Jesus freak.

696
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:06,046
So she, um, she just
wants to help, okay?

697
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,356
Charm has begun to
experience blackouts

698
01:04:15,422 --> 01:04:17,659
along with an extreme
personality disorder

699
01:04:17,726 --> 01:04:20,227
in which her body
physically alters.

700
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:22,196
I have tracked a
continuous high fever,

701
01:04:22,262 --> 01:04:27,468
noting flashes of clarity
between 102 and 104.4 degrees.

702
01:04:27,535 --> 01:04:31,539
We'll attempt to maintain
that 2.4 degree safe zone

703
01:04:31,972 --> 01:04:36,043
via a controlled
methadone overdose.

704
01:04:36,745 --> 01:04:38,946
That's extremely
questionable parenting.

705
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:44,586
Yesterday, I would've called
that plain manic overkill,

706
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:45,486
but today?

707
01:04:47,756 --> 01:04:49,156
Porcupines, though?

708
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:52,259
What kind of fever conjures
farm animals out of thin air?

709
01:04:52,326 --> 01:04:54,294
Mm, porcupines aren't
farm animals, Liz.

710
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:55,329
Kory!

711
01:04:55,864 --> 01:04:56,964
Liz.

712
01:04:57,732 --> 01:04:58,733
You know there's a theory

713
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,001
that 10% is what we
use of our brains

714
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:04,639
and that full capacity
operation could be the result

715
01:05:04,706 --> 01:05:08,877
in unlocking of powers like
telepathy, telekinesis,

716
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:12,446
that'd mean we'd only be
limited by our imagination.

717
01:05:14,516 --> 01:05:15,983
I don't know, it's kinda
like the Green Lantern,

718
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:17,519
right, but without the rings?

719
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:21,656
Don't try to tell us the same
lies you tell her, Faith.

720
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:23,625
We know better.

721
01:05:23,758 --> 01:05:25,025
There are documented studies

722
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,629
of drastic physical transitions.

723
01:05:27,695 --> 01:05:28,462
I could show you.

724
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:30,397
Your room was interesting.

725
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:33,802
That lab you got there is
rudimentary to say the least.

726
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:35,235
Fuck you.

727
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:39,908
Tell me about your compound,
Faith, about your cure.

728
01:05:39,973 --> 01:05:41,509
Fuck you.

729
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,680
Fine. We'll just skip
to the lightning round.

730
01:05:49,049 --> 01:05:50,819
You might out of methadone,

731
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:53,487
but your garage is
stocked full, huh?

732
01:05:53,555 --> 01:05:54,955
Fucking antifreeze?

733
01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:56,323
Two questions.

734
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,894
What kind of mother pumps her
little girl full of this shit?

735
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:03,197
And what kind of little
girl gets pumped full

736
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:06,634
of this shit and doesn't die?

737
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:11,438
Admit your hand in this,
Faith, and convince me

738
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:15,108
that there is something at
work here other than the devil.

739
01:06:16,343 --> 01:06:21,716
The devil. You little bitch.

740
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:23,918
You don't know shit.

741
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:26,386
You don't know what it's
like to pull yourself out

742
01:06:26,453 --> 01:06:29,724
from the brink, to pull
your baby out, too,

743
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:32,794
with no help, no one.

744
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,530
Just the storm and
the resentment.

745
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:39,032
You don't know what it's
like to be a mother!

746
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:41,936
So you can take your good book

747
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,539
and your fairy tale
fucking holiday!

748
01:06:44,606 --> 01:06:45,640
You mean Christmas?

749
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:46,841
And your Ten Commandments.

750
01:06:46,908 --> 01:06:48,643
It's the season of His birth.

751
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,410
And you can go straight to hell!

752
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:00,588
That spiked bat wasn't
meant for us, was it?

753
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:04,124
You're scared.

754
01:07:06,226 --> 01:07:09,029
How many more weapons do you
have stashed around here?

755
01:07:10,565 --> 01:07:16,503
You have taken this as far
as you can go. Further, even.

756
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:19,273
What are you holding onto?

757
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:22,877
What is the sin whose
shadow in which you live?

758
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:30,284
It is time to put
your confidence

759
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:36,156
in something other than
yourself for her sake.

760
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:38,358
Just say the word.

761
01:07:40,995 --> 01:07:42,030
You want my blessing?

762
01:07:42,095 --> 01:07:44,599
Yes. Yes, I do.

763
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:47,702
Don't touch her.

764
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:53,473
If you fucking touch her...

765
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:10,792
It'll be painless, Faith.

766
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,730
We just invoke His name
and we let Him decide

767
01:08:15,797 --> 01:08:22,336
who's right or wrong,
our truth or your poison.

768
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:25,740
Don't lay a finger on her.
Don't you fucking touch her!

769
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:53,266
Kory.

770
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:03,611
Get out!

771
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:06,446
-is Christ the King
-Get out of here!

772
01:09:06,514 --> 01:09:09,282
Stop!

773
01:09:11,052 --> 01:09:12,386
Get back here.

774
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:15,056
Get back!

775
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:15,890
Get out! Mom!

776
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:17,892
-Mom!
-Coming!

777
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:24,398
No!

778
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:25,900
Mom!

779
01:09:39,379 --> 01:09:41,916
Oh, fuck!

780
01:09:51,224 --> 01:09:53,161
Breathe. Apply pressure.

781
01:09:54,996 --> 01:09:59,567
Okay. Okay, so we're oh for one.

782
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:02,070
You're never gonna
convince her you're right.

783
01:10:02,436 --> 01:10:04,438
Your sister was
right about one thing.

784
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:09,744
I am shooting in the dark.
Fever is all that I have.

785
01:10:10,511 --> 01:10:13,614
I just, I have to get control.

786
01:10:13,681 --> 01:10:18,351
Well, you had control,
but now it does.

787
01:10:19,252 --> 01:10:20,688
We gotta leave her.

788
01:10:21,155 --> 01:10:22,990
No, no!

789
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:25,793
All right, well, um, uh, uh,

790
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,663
Liz's stun gun in her bag maybe?

791
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:58,325
I won't let anyone else
ever hurt her again!

792
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:14,976
Hey, hey, somebody. Liz!

793
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:00,915
Wait!

794
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:07,355
P- pl- please, please don't go.

795
01:13:12,093 --> 01:13:13,460
Good luck, Nightingale.

796
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:42,757
Shit. Shit.

797
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:53,567
Oh!

798
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:19,727
Okay, fuck.

799
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:03,871
Where is she?

800
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:07,842
Tell me she's not out there.

801
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:12,780
Oh God, Jesus.

802
01:15:18,786 --> 01:15:19,754
What if,

803
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:25,292
what if He won't take me?

804
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:39,640
Then you just come on back.

805
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:27,088
When you said you
made mistakes before,

806
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:28,122
was I one of them?

807
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:30,357
No. No, baby.

808
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:32,760
I, I thought I,

809
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:35,530
I thought I saw something.

810
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:36,730
I thought I saw something.

811
01:16:36,931 --> 01:16:38,766
Part of
recovering is letting go.

812
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:41,570
I would never.

813
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:43,137
She has this old
suitcase from her party days.

814
01:16:44,672 --> 01:16:45,673
I would never.

815
01:16:46,173 --> 01:16:49,410
No one feels guilty if
they're destroying something

816
01:16:49,477 --> 01:16:50,411
in order to build.

817
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:54,615
I just can't do this!
I need help!

818
01:17:05,493 --> 01:17:09,096
I can't! Wait, no, I can't!

819
01:17:09,163 --> 01:17:11,600
I don't want to! No!

820
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,675
I can't do it.

821
01:17:21,742 --> 01:17:23,911
I won't fucking do it!

822
01:17:26,615 --> 01:17:30,784
Please, please,
I won't fucking do it.

823
01:17:31,218 --> 01:17:34,121
Please, please, no!

824
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,097
You know,
when they delivered you,

825
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:44,999
I was so disoriented
from the drugs,

826
01:17:45,065 --> 01:17:46,667
I knew that I
couldn't be there for you,

827
01:17:49,203 --> 01:17:50,639
but this time I'm here
to pull you out the dark.

828
01:17:51,005 --> 01:17:53,440
I'm here to pull
you out of the dark.

829
01:17:53,908 --> 01:17:55,276
Pull you out of the dark.

830
01:17:55,577 --> 01:17:56,844
Pull you out of the dark.

831
01:21:49,544 --> 01:21:51,311
Come on. Charm!

832
01:22:54,843 --> 01:22:56,276
KLU,
Louisville, Kentucky.

833
01:22:56,343 --> 01:22:59,179
K-top mornings with the bishop.
Get your shorts out, folks.

834
01:22:59,246 --> 01:23:01,583
We got a high of 75 today.

835
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:05,118
Spring sprung it in January,
a few months early it seems.

836
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:07,120
there are reports all
over the Louisville area

837
01:23:07,187 --> 01:23:09,223
of flash floodings
melting off the snow

838
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:11,559
from last week's
white out blizzard,

839
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:13,227
so be careful out there.

840
01:23:13,293 --> 01:23:14,662
Don't be a stranger over here.

841
01:23:16,063 --> 01:23:17,498
Do you have any
plans this morning?

842
01:23:17,565 --> 01:23:18,733
I'm happy
about it. I'll still-

843
01:23:19,399 --> 01:23:21,168
Gonna add some flowers
to my painting.

844
01:23:21,235 --> 01:23:23,337
You know,
dig into my multimedia bag.

845
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:26,173
Some, oh, maybe you should
try some gold leafing.

846
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:27,642
I can help you pick some.

847
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:30,277
Of course. The more the merrier.

848
01:23:31,078 --> 01:23:31,846
I'll go change.

849
01:23:31,913 --> 01:23:33,080
Okay.

850
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:40,588
Mom?

851
01:23:40,655 --> 01:23:41,523
Yeah?

852
01:23:43,925 --> 01:23:45,092
Thanks.

853
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:47,261
For what?

854
01:23:48,362 --> 01:23:51,533
Pulling me out of the dark
like you said you would.

855
01:24:51,358 --> 01:24:54,194
Tell me the worst
thing you've ever done.

856
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:56,263
I was a bad person.

857
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:12,212
You're not gonna get a
bigger crown in heaven

858
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:14,348
trying to save something
that's already lost.

859
01:25:14,414 --> 01:25:16,718
What the fuck are we
doing here then, Liz?

860
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:20,855
I, I don't believe, I had
a connection, you know?

861
01:25:20,922 --> 01:25:22,023
Yeah, I bet.

862
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:23,290
No, it's, it's more than that.

863
01:25:23,357 --> 01:25:27,227
It's, it's the, she, I
think she'll listen to me,

864
01:25:28,596 --> 01:25:29,697
so I gotta try.

865
01:25:36,169 --> 01:25:39,841
Kory, she doesn't
want to be saved.

866
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,062
Hey!

867
01:26:09,037 --> 01:26:10,104
Come with me.

868
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,217
I wanna help you.

869
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:25,653
Mm.

870
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:27,021
Let's get outta here.

871
01:26:27,088 --> 01:26:28,488
We can leave.
We can go somewhere else.

872
01:26:31,993 --> 01:26:35,395
Shh. Shh.

873
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:49,977
I'm gonna cum so hard when
I pop your fucking cherry.

874
01:26:54,281 --> 01:26:55,215
What are you doing?

875
01:26:55,683 --> 01:26:58,218
Faith. Faith, what the
fuck, what the fuck?

876
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:19,439
I enjoyed
corrupting innocence.

877
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:26,446
Somebody help!

878
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:29,851
Somebody help!

879
01:27:36,991 --> 01:27:38,358
You hammer,

880
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:40,828
I'll see to his knee, and we'll
figure out the rest later.

881
01:27:41,596 --> 01:27:44,364
Who are you now?
Our little home invader?

882
01:27:45,332 --> 01:27:48,603
Charm, it's me, Liz.

883
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:51,739
Yeah, I know who you are

884
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,009
Uh, this is Liz and that's Kory.

885
01:28:10,057 --> 01:28:13,060
Take your fucking medicine!

886
01:28:15,163 --> 01:28:17,430
Don't you fucking touch her!

887
01:28:17,497 --> 01:28:20,968
I won't let anyone else
ever hurt her again!

888
01:28:23,137 --> 01:28:24,806
I can't keep this up.

889
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:38,653
Wait.

890
01:28:43,624 --> 01:28:44,592
Wait.

891
01:28:45,358 --> 01:28:46,294
You stay back!

892
01:28:48,095 --> 01:28:49,462
You get away!

893
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:51,699
Please, please don't go.

894
01:28:54,235 --> 01:28:55,136
Please.

895
01:29:49,422 --> 01:29:51,458
No one's getting
out of this zoo.
