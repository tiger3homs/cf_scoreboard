177
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,375
Welcome back, sir.
There's something I should tell you.

178
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:14,166
The cost of that ink
will be deducted from your pay.

179
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,416
What? The ink?
Oh. Oh, the ink. Of course, sir, yes.

180
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,416
Get on with your work, Cratchit.

181
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,957
- If it's not too much of an inconvenience.
- But, sir...

182
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,541
- I do not wish to be disturbed.
- [Bob] Yes.

shall we?

How does it go again?
Oh, yes, yes, the question.

"Uncle, won't you join me
for Christmas dinner tomorrow?"

191
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
The answer,

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,582
"No, Harry, I will not."

193
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:57,457
"Christmas is a humbug.
I despise it and all it stands for."

The same answer to the same question
you ask me every year.

195
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,416
I have no time to be merry.

196
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,625
Just because my partner is dead doesn't
mean I have no business to attend to.

197
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:11,707
Quite the opposite. Jacob Marley died
seven years ago this very night,

198
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,082
leaving me nothing but business.

199

Oh, yes, and you.

Oh, come now, Uncle.
Hela and I would just love to have you.

Hela? Who's Hela?

202
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,332
You know, Hela, my wife.

203
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,875
She was disappointed
you couldn't attend the wedding,

204
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:29,375
and simply can't wait to meet you.

205
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:32,125

One such disappointment came
on the glorious Christmas Day

217
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,457
that you stumbled into this world.

218
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,332
The very same Christmas Day your mother,

219
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,207
my beloved sister, left it.

220
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,500
I will not be joining you
for Christmas dinner,

221

of this wretched season.

And my financial burdens are considerable.

I knew leaving you
in the care of Uncle Scrooge

375
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,040
was the right thing to do, hmm? Didn't I?

376
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,665
Hmm? Yes, I did. I did. [chuckles]

377
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,915
I do apologize
for the dramatic entrance, old boy.

Goes with the territory, you see.

00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,958
But I'm sure you and I can discuss
the rest like reasonable men.

381
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,375
Ah, I must have drifted off by the fire.

382
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm dreaming.

383
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:58,458

This is no dream.

393
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,040
Look upon the chain that binds me.

394
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:29,915
In life, I forged it,
link by link, yard by yard.

395
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,833
It grew to match my greed.

396
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:36,540
In death, I will never be rid of it.

397
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,540
Nor will you yours.

398
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,165
[gasps] Mine?

399
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,915
Yes, yours.

Trapped in our own selfish worlds.

405
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,415
We never reached out
to our fellow men in life,

406
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,625
so are condemned to do so in death.

407
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,625
We have watched you many a day, Scrooge.

408
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:16,875
Watched your chain grow,
link by link, yard by yard.

409
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,250
But you may yet escape our fate.

410
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:25,083
I have pulled a few chains

411
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:29,915
and arranged for three visitors
to call on you before morning.

412
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,125
The first, when the bell tolls 1:00.

413
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,625
The second, at 2:00.

414
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,208
And the third, at...

415
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,290
Well, 3:00.

Listen to these visitors. Learn from them.

419
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,708
And heed my warning

420
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,125
before it's too late.

Humbug.

It's that nephew of mine. Interfering.
Bringing my blood to the boil.

438

Has me jumping at shadows.
Seeing things. Yes.

It's Scrooge, isn't it?

468
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:40,540
Yes, that's the one, Scrooge.
[chuckles] What a funny name.

469
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,750
Are you comfortable down there, Scrooge?

470
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,958
Uh, well...

471
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,375
Never mind that.

472
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:50,208
Who, or what, are you?

473
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,290
And it's "Mr. Scrooge," if you please.

474
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,750
Well, Mr. Scrooge-if-you-please, who am I?

475
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:00,833
I can be anyone you have ever known.
I can even be you.

[whimpers]

477
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,165
Bah, humbugs.

478
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,083
Christmas is an outrage.

479
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:09,208
Grr, give me your money.

480
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,165
- Interest rates, and so on.
- Hmm.

481
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,250
You were not told of my coming?

482
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,875
No? No matter.

483
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:22,625
You have nothing to fear from me.
After all, your welfare is my business.

484
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:27,915
Miss, to be disturbed at this hour
is hardly conducive to my welfare.

485
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,125
Your redemption, then.

486
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,750
You see, an old friend of yours

487
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:37,625
asked me to illuminate
a thing or two for you. I...

488
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,375
Illuminate what, exactly?

489
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,625
I was getting to that.
You are an impatient one. [clears throat]

490
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,625
I will show you the past.

491
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,583
Christmas past.

492
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:54,125
Specifically, your Christmas past. Ahh!

493
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:57,250
There. Much better.

494
00:27:58,665 --> 00:27:59,875
I've gone mad.

495
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:01,875
Mad, you say?

Whispers in the wind.

498
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:11,165
A blizzard indoors.

499
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,208
Now you, a talking waxwork
with a wick for brains.

500
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,458
My dreams are never this... exciting.

501
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,915
And none of this can be real.
So, yes, I must be awake,

502
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,833
but quite insane.

503
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,040
Well, I may have wick for brains,
but I do think I'm real.

504
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,208
Here.

505
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,833
- [growls]
- [Past] Oh, hush now.

506
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,583
There, did that feel real?

507
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:36,958
I-I suppose it did.

508
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,625
It hurt too.

509
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:43,458
[chuckles] Yes, the past can hurt.
Especially yours.

510
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,375
But it can also heal,
if you learn from it.

511
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,915
- Now, come with me.
- Absolutely not.

512
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,625
I refuse to go anywhere...

513
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,333
[Past] Whee!

514
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:55,500

gone back to work for Wiggyfiz?

Of course not!

No. No apologies, Ebenezer.

Times are hard,
and my financial burdens are considerable.

768

Should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?

There's one problem. I'm not sure whether
to stuff the goose with the stuffing,

1051
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,833
or stuff the stuffing with the goose.

It is a lean Christmas,
there's no denying that.

1055
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,625
But we have each other
and we have the children.

1056
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,958
We can still make the most of it.

1057
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:56,958
In fact, I do believe this will be
the best Cratchit Christmas ever.

Oh! Scrooge?

1068
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,833
What are you trying to do,
spoil our Christmas?

1069
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:26,708
But his money paid for the goose, my dear.

1070
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,875
No, your money paid for the goose.

1071
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:33,208
- If you can even call that a goose.
- But he paid me the money.

1072
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,458
Because you earned it.

1073
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:38,291
Believe me, you earned that money, Bob.

1074
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,083
Mr. Scrooge assures me
that times are hard, my dear.

1075
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:45,916
Times <i>are </i>hard. For us, not him.

1076
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,750
Nonetheless, he is the founder
of our feast, and we should drink to him.

1078

I'd like to give him
something to feast on.

1080

For the love and happiness he brings us.

And to our Tiny Tim,
for the health we wish him.

And, for the sake of your dear father,

1086

I will even drink
to that old miser, Mr. Scrooge.

1087
