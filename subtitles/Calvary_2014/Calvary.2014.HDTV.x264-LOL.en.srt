1
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:15,117
I first tasted semen
when I was 7 years old.

2
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,040
Nothing to say?

3
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,170
It's certainly
a startling opening line.

4
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,007
What's that, irony?

5
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,677
I'm sorry,
let's start again.

6
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,688
What do you want to say to me?

7
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,358
I'm here to listen to
whatever you have to say.

8
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:51,028
I was raped by a priest
when I was 7 years old.

9
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,365
Orally and anally,
as they say in the court reports.

10
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,748
This went on for 5 years.
Every other day for 5 years.

11
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:09,296
I bled a lot, as you can imagine.
I bled a terrible amount.

12
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,262
Have you spoken to
anyone about this?

13
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,222
I'm speaking to you. Now.

14
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,310
I mean, have you
sought professional help?

15
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,146
Why, so I could learn how to cope?

16
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,230
So I could learn
how to live with it?

17
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,483
Maybe I don't want to cope.

18
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,818
Maybe I don't want to learn
how to live with it.

19
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,663
Why don't you make a formal complaint?
You can testify.

20
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,247
The man's dead.

21
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,799
I don't know what to say to you.

22
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,927
I have no answer for you,
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:01,473
What good would it do anyway,
if he were still alive?

24
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,103
What would be the point
in killing the bastard?

25
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,608
That would be no news.
There's no point in killing a bad priest.

26
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,903
But killing a good one?
That would be a shock now.

27
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,615
They wouldn't know
what to make of that.

28
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,495
I'm going to kill you, Father.

29
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,956
I'm gonna kill you
because you've done nothing wrong.

30
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,960
I'm gonna kill you
because you're innocent.

31
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,923
Not right now, though.

32
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,218
I'll give you enough time
to put your house in order.

33
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,638
Make your peace with God.

34
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,144
Sunday week, let's say.

35
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:50,272
I'll meet you down on the beach.
Down by the water.

36
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,903
Killing a priest
on a Sunday.

37
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,865
That'll be a good one.

38
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,204
Do you not have anything
to say to me, Father?

39
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,001
Not right now, no.

40
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:14,129
But I'm sure I'll
think of something by Sunday week.

41
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,692
Body of Christ.

42
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,365
Body of Christ.

43
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,038
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

44
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,042
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

45
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,295
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

46
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,172
A little too much wine
in the chalice again, there, Michael.

47
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,475
Sorry, Father.

48
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,312
I'm wondering is this some
kind of ploy on your behalf.

49
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,730
Ploy, Father?

50
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,233
I've noticed my stocks
of booze appear to be

51
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,610
somewhat diminished
of late.

52
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,612
Is this some kind of ploy

53
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,240
to cover up for the wine you've
been imbibing on the QT.

54
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,160
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

55
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,495
Father Leary
noticed nothing amiss.

56
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,790
Father Leary does not know you
as well as I do, Michael.

57
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,502
He may well underestimate the depths
of your Machiavellian chicanery.

58
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,963
Can I go now, Father?

59
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,798
What's the hurry?

60
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,175
Have they called a meeting
at Mafia Headquarters?

61
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,473
On your way.

62
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,483
Things you hear in
confession these days.

63
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,944
Hmm.

64
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,237
It's depressing.

65
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,781
You have to detach
yourself from it.

66
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,367
We're here to provide solace.
Your personal feelings don't come into it.

67
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,872
I know that.
What do you take me for?

68
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,877
It's difficult, though. The mess
people make of their lives.

69
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,338
What's the problem? Without
going into details, obviously.

70
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,841
Your one with the big black eye on her.
Have you seen her?

71
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,343
Veronica Brennan. Yeah.

72
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,843
She's an odd one.

73
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,930
Things she comes out with.

74
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,057
It's like she's trying to
drag you down into the muck.

75
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,850
Do you know what felching is?

76
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,685
I do know what felching is, yeah.

77
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,648
I had to look it up.

78
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,565
This is you not
going into details is it?

79
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,067
Sorry.

80
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,321
Anyway, whatever's going on
it's obviously all gotten out of hand.

81
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,738
She's getting
knocked around now.

82
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,158
Well if you say anything
to her she'll raise holy hell...

83
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,935
...say it was the basis of something
she said to you in confession.

84
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,582
We can't have that. She'll get
me excommunicated, the cow.

85
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,420
I'll have a word with her.
Jack as well.

86
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,590
Part of my pastoral duties
and what have you.

87
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,759
Nothing to do with her
confession or anything.

88
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,552
See what's going on.
Hmm.

89
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:53,223
That colored fella,
the Ugandan?

90
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,641
He's one of
her lovers, I think.

91
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,560
Simon's from the Ivory Coast.

92
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,730
Right, right. I knew
it was that, or Guyana.

93
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,065
One of those African countries.

94
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,903
Guyana is in South America.

95
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,490
I don't think so, Father.

96
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,785
I was always pretty good
at the auld geography.

97
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,143
Not bad.

98
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,602
Surprisingly.

99
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:43,566
I was expecting a daub.

100
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,903
Who are these two lads?

101
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,659
Don't know. I'm reading
these ghost stories.

102
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,203
Maybe it's got
something to do with that.

103
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,496
Spooky.

104
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,292
So, do you know who it was?

105
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,378
Yes, I know who it was.

106
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,297
Do you know him well?

107
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,715
Well enough.

108
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,010
Knowing this man as you do,
do you think it was an idle threat?

109
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,347
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

110
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,518
Not sure means it's possible.

111
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,187
Yes, I suppose.

112
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,774
You didn't grant him
absolution, obviously.

113
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,692
He didn't ask for it.

114
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,861
Well there you have it.

115
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:15,908
The man is not penitent.
There is no contrition.

116
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,202
He's threatening
to commit a crime,

117
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,705
not asking for
forgiveness for one.

118
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,043
The inviolability of the
sacramental seal does not apply.

119
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,169
You're saying I should
go to the police?

120
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,216
I'm not saying anything, James.

121
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,385
The choice is yours.

122
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:57,408
Don't tell me.
You made the classic error.

123
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,870
You're supposed to cut down,
not across.

124
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,043
This is Bruno.

125
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,969
And I always wanted
a fast car. A red one.

126
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,431
I thought you'd already
had your mid-life crisis.

127
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:29,981
<i>This old world
may never change</i>

128
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,110
<i>The way it's been</i>

129
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,618
<i>And all the ways of war</i>

130
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,873
<i>Can't change it back again</i>

131
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,917
You're a very
nice-looking young woman.

132
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,796
Thank you.
I like your bow-tie.

133
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,298
It's got polka-dots.

134
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,302
This is my daughter, Fiona, Milo.
She's over from London.

135
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,803
You're having me on.

136
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,683
I'm not having you on.
What are you on about?

137
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:04,225
But you're a priest.

138
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,684
I was married
before I became a priest.

139
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:10,480
My wife and I had a child, Fiona.
My wife died.

140
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,649
And after that I joined
the priesthood.

141
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,945
You can do that,
can you?

142
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,947
It would appear so.

143
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:22,076
Don't tell me. You made
the classic error.

144
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,661
I've already done
that gag, Frank.

145
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,995
You're supposed to cut down.

146
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,413
I said I've already done it!

147
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,664
Now, now!

148
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,509
A drop of the hard
stuff for yourself.

149
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,421
And a generous serving of
the auld water of life

150
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,673
for this beautiful,
yet troubled...

151
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,591
Oh, fuck off.

152
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,345
You've an exceedingly dirty mouth.
I like that in a hoor.

153
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,721
Brendan.
Now's not the time.

154
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,727
Whatever you say, Father.
You're the boss.

155
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,732
How's that working out for you?

156
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,572
I haven't been on
the tear in a good while.

157
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,361
So you say.

158
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,323
No, no, I've been a very good lad.
And don't change the subject.

159
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,201
What was the subject?

160
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,869
You know what the subject was.

161
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,955
Oh, Daddy, a man.

162
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,999
A man. What else.

163
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,500
It's getting to
be a habit, honey.

164
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,379
I know. It's pathetic.
I can't do anything right.

165
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,923
Nice shades.

166
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,676
Do they make me
look like Jackie O?

167
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,094
Not really, no.

168
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:11,684
This what you came to gawp at?
Nasty, huh?

169
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,020
An interesting color.

170
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,732
They say you can find beauty in
everything, if you look hard enough.

171
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,693
Well I'd say you can find
beauty in most things...

172
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,205
...not everything.

173
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:24,475
That's nonsense.

174
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,618
What would I know? I'm
just an auld washerwoman.

175
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,658
Listen, if you don't want
to talk to me, that's fine.

176
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,706
I'm not here to compel
you to do anything.

177
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,457
You never know,
Father...

178
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,626
maybe I'd like
to be compelled.

179
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,796
Maybe I'd enjoy it.

180
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,841
I'll have a word with Jack. See
what he has to say for himself.

181
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,388
Grand Inquisitor, huh? Go
on ahead for yourself so.

182
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,347
I'm sure he'll be
only too pleased

183
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,182
to have someone else
to bore the ears off.

184
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,726
I stopped listening
to his auld shite a long time ago.

185
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,272
That's how it is, is it?
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

186
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,817
You thought we were
another Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier?

187
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,945
Well now, that wasn't
a very happy marriage,

188
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,738
so it's not a great analogy.

189
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,119
That's what I've always
liked about you, Father.

190
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,287
You're just a little too
sharp for this parish.

191
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,081
Mad fella he was.

192
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:17,960
Decapitated the two of them. Blood
all over the place.

193
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,294
Hiya, Father.
Jack.

194
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,967
Could I have a word...
in private?

195
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,803
Sounds ominous.

196
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,057
Where's Johnnie Cochran
when you need him, huh?

197
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,856
I hope we don't
get locked in here.

198
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,359
We'll have to make
love to keep warm.

199
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,990
I had a word
with Veronica, Jack.

200
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,951
You were out to the house, were you?
ls everything all right?

201
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,873
Everything's fine. I mean,
no, everything's not fine.

202
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:00,418
Mass on Sunday, with the
shades and everything?

203
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,379
Ah, that.
Yes, that.

204
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,755
Are you laying into her
or what's going on?

205
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,716
That wasn't me, now.
No, no, that's that

206
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,677
Black fella that
she's been seeing.

207
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,511
The colored fella
she's been seeing.

208
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,347
I didn't mean to be racist.
That was a slip of the tongue.

209
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,351
Are you saying he beats her up?
Don't quote me,

210
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,519
but that's what
I'm assuming. Yeah.

211
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,937
I mean, she speaks in
riddles half of the time,

212
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,524
I can't make any
sense out of her.

213
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,821
I think she's bi-polar, or
lactose-intolerant, one of the two.

214
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,158
I don't know where I am
with her any more, Father.

215
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,202
And if I'm honest with you, I'm kinda
glad to have her off my hands.

216
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,452
What, even if this new
fella's knocking her about?

217
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,914
But what's that
to do with me?

218
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,334
What?

219
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,044
Not everyone can carry
the weight of the world.

220
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,423
What about your marriage?
The oaths you took?

221
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,219
Listen.

222
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,181
She's happier now
that she's seeing him.

223
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:57,392
A lot more settled down,
a lot calmer.

224
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,727
And I'm not under
surveillance any more.

225
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,813
I can just reel in
whatever time I like.

226
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,192
So everybody's happy.

227
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,152
Where's the harm in that?

228
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,366
Shall I cut you a side
of beef to take home?

229
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,326
It's freshly slaughtered.

230
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,289
Simon.
Hello, Father.

231
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,795
I'm rather busy today.

232
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,088
It's not about my car.

233
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:31,259
It's about Mrs. Brennan.
You're her boyfriend?

234
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,557
I fuck her from time to time.
Does that make me her boyfriend?

235
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,682
Does around here.

236
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,935
She has a lot of boyfriends,
so I've heard.

237
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,020
Is that right?

238
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,749
Do you want me
to confess to adultery?

239
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,076
Is that why you are here?

240
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,818
Somebody beat her up.

241
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,487
She told you I beat her up?

242
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,572
No, she didn't.

243
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,198
Then why are you here?

244
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,701
Somebody beat her up.

245
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,619
It's either you
or the husband.

246
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,958
I do not think Jack beat her up.
He's not the type.

247
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,750
What is the type?

248
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,214
Some of them like to be hit,
you know.

249
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,299
Who?

250
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,634
White women.
Irish women.

251
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,971
Do not ask me why.
You would have to be a psychiatrist.

252
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,517
- That's nonsense.
- No, no, they like to be hit.

253
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,229
In certain situations
they beg for it, in fact.

254
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:26,431
So she got what was coming to her,
did she?

255
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,900
I was speaking generally.

256
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,693
Oh, you were speaking generally.

257
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,779
Well I'm speaking specifically.

258
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,992
- Don't do it again.
- You cannot tell me what to do.

259
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,442
We're not in the Missions now.

260
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,494
Oh, the Missions, right.

261
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,289
Are you going to chop off
my hand if I disobey you?

262
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,208
You know your history,
that's grand.

263
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,960
I like to read.

264
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,795
You probably think
that Black people cannot

265
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,883
Yeah, Black people, White people,
blah, blah, blah.

266
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,763
Run along now, Father.
Your sermon is finished.

267
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,228
Better watch your step there.

268
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,688
Why is that?

269
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,898
Well, if it was him
who was laying into her,

270
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,108
you'll have to tread
very carefully there.

271
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,237
It's a very sensitive area.

272
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,996
You'll have to explain
this to me, Father.

273
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,741
I'm afraid you've
lost me completely.

274
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:24,498
The Church can't be seen to be getting
involved in matters of diversity.

275
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,333
Do you know?

276
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,670
Oh, you mean if beating her up is
one of those ethnic rituals or something?

277
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,757
Like when they do that thing
when they shake hands?

278
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,679
You're mocking me now, I can tell.

279
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,432
We have to be very circumspect in
those areas, is all I'm saying.

280
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,727
Oh, I'll be very circumspect, Father.
Don't you worry about that.

281
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,770
<i>That's why he said</i>

282
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,693
<i>I need someone to love me</i>

283
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:59,907
<i>Need somebody to carry me home</i>

284
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,202
<i>To San Francisco</i>

285
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,375
How is all?

286
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,877
At death's door. You?

287
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,296
Same.

288
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,342
Still using the old typewriter, I see.
Bit of an affectation.

289
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,261
My whole life has
been an affectation.

290
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,763
That's one of those
lines that sounds witty

291
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,598
but doesn't actually
make much sense.

292
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,434
Caught out again.

293
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,688
How's the latest
masterpiece coming?

294
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,692
Better than Cecelia Ahern,
but not as good as Banville.

295
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,652
You could say
that about everybody.

296
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,612
Now what have you got for me?

297
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,655
Ooh.

298
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,409
Oh!

299
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,750
Need anything else?

300
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,753
A gun.

301
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,337
Huh?

302
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,842
A Walther PPK should suffice.

303
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,803
James Bond's weapon of choice.

304
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,346
Old Adolf killed himself
with one in the bunker.

305
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,182
That's the plan, is it?

306
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,393
I've no intention
of writhing around

307
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:11,104
in agony for hours on end
when the time comes.

308
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,940
Not knowing who I am
or where I am.

309
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,275
Nonsense.

310
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,609
Pragmatism.

311
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,070
Where would I get a gun from?

312
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,823
Oh, come on now,
give me a break.

313
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,160
You've never been short of guns
in this country, have you?

314
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,705
God, you're awful maudlin
today, I must say.

315
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,807
You don't have any photographs.

316
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,269
No.

317
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,731
I'm in agreement with the
Apaches on that score.

318
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,192
The Apaches?

319
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,737
The Apaches.
The Arapaho.

320
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,405
The Hunkpapa Sioux.

321
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,582
Not even one of mum?

322
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,503
I don't need a photograph
to remember your mother.

323
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,134
Memories fade, though.

324
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,181
That's what's so
terrible about them.

325
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,184
No, they don't.

326
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,855
Not really.

327
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,361
I should buy a cane.

328
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,074
It would suit you. You're
old beyond your years.

329
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,618
Give me a feeling
of imperiousness.

330
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,953
And you could lean on it.

331
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,329
I could lean on it.

332
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,499
Reflectively.

333
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,501
Point things out.

334
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,421
Club someone to death with it.

335
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,338
A blunt instrument, yeah.

336
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:02,923
Who, though?

337
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:06,219
A certain young man
from Rathmines.

338
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,224
Aren't all instruments blunt?

339
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,020
Flugelhorns?

340
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,236
Who's this now?

341
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,363
This is my daughter,
Fiona.

342
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,282
Oh, right. Like a French
novel or something.

343
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,826
What was the fella's name?
Bernanos.

344
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,077
Michael Fitzgerald.

345
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,873
I bought the big house
up the road.

346
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,415
Haven't seen you
at Mass recently...

347
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,000
I've been too busy.

348
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,253
I was thinking of getting a
chapel built on the grounds.

349
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,631
Like <i>Brideshead Revisited.</i>

350
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,634
Then you could pop in freelance.
Save me the trouble.

351
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:47,801
Lovely creature.

352
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,680
Really expensive, too.
Prime horse flesh this is.

353
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,848
Interesting man,
your father.

354
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,099
That right?

355
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,729
A fine man. Nobody round here has
a bad word to say about him.

356
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,814
Makes you wonder
what he's hiding.

357
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,482
God, you're a fucking prick.

358
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:05,694
Oh, feisty! I'm only codding.
No offense meant, as they say.

359
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,449
Father, swing by
the house one afternoon.

360
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,124
I have a proposition
might interest you.

361
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,826
- Really?
- Yes, really.

362
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,497
A financial proposition.
That interests you, doesn't it?

363
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,958
It would be a black day

364
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,626
when the Catholic Church is no
longer interested in money.

365
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,045
Huh?!

366
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:26,840
Inspector Stanton.

367
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,718
The clergy at this time
of the night.

368
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,679
When I could be
getting up to all sorts.

369
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,977
Well, hey, Fada. Whaddaya hear,
whaddaya say!

370
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,354
I'm sorry. I didn't
realize you had company.

371
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,398
It's only little Leo.

372
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,488
You checking out
my ass, Fada?

373
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,280
No.

374
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,826
He's only messing with you, Father.
What can I do for you?

375
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,872
Oh, I've nothing to hide from Leo.
Have I, Leo?

376
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,084
Your life's an open book, Gerry.
Like your ass.

377
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,337
Is this a police matter, Father?

378
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,134
No, it's a personal...
a personal thing.

379
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,510
It's a personal,
a personal thing.

380
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:16,516
You look worried, Fada.
My advice, take it on the lamaster, huh.

381
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,601
You don't wanna drop in
for the phonus-balonus

382
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,104
and wind up with a sock in the kisser.
Get me?

383
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,521
He's not in the mood, Leo.

384
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,482
Maybe I can cheer up
the old sourpuss.

385
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:29,445
I'll show you a good time, Fada.
'Good Time Leo', that's me.

386
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,156
Although it'll be extra if I
let you wear the cassock.

387
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,784
I know what you holy-rollers
are like when you get going.

388
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,327
Hell's bells, mama!

389
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,374
I'm outta here.

390
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:52,009
He's a character, huh?

391
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,971
What's troubling you, Father?
You seem agitated.

392
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,807
I need a favor.

393
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,478
My great-grandfather's.

394
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,646
Said he took it off
one of the Cairo Gang

395
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,857
when they shot them all
on Bloody Sunday.

396
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,153
The first Bloody Sunday,
obviously.

397
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,656
You ever had call to use it?

398
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,366
Yeah.

399
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,330
I killed a man with it once
in the Wicklow Mountains.

400
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,665
What case was that?

401
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,669
He was just pissing me off.

402
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:36,346
Somebody been threatening you, Father?
What have you been up to now?

403
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,099
Not you as well, huh?

404
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,903
What did you say you
wanted it for, Father?

405
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,526
I didn't say.

406
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,277
I'd say you wanted it
for your dog.

407
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,948
The dog's dying.
It's in pain.

408
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,784
You're worried you may have to put it
out of its misery one of these days.

409
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,076
Isn't that right?

410
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,121
My dog's dying.
It's in pain.

411
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,061
I'm worried I might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days.

412
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,916
An act of compassion?

413
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,085
Well I can't argue with that.

414
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,461
I'm a compassionate man myself.

415
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,465
- I had one of those, you know. Early on.
- One of what?

416
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,386
Pedophile priest.
20 years ago now this was, in Dublin.

417
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,763
Young girl made a complaint.
A rape.

418
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,890
What happened?

419
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,136
What do you think happened?

420
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,394
I arrested the bastard,
48 hours later

421
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,604
I was packing my bags
and making my way out West.

422
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:27,896
They moved you on?

423
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,231
Reassigned, yeah.

424
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,651
What happened to him?

425
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,403
I was told they were sending him

426
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,154
to one of the missions overseas.
Africa.

427
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:38,074
He could do whatever he
wanted over there, I suppose.

428
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,034
Thanks, anyway.

429
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,244
Like the man in the
dicky bow says, Father,

430
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,538
"Protect yourself at all times".

431
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,925
How long have you
been at this craic?

432
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,260
Last couple of years.

433
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,347
Supposed to be therapeutic.

434
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,724
Maybe I should take it up.

435
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,144
Maybe you should.
Are you seeing someone in London?

436
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,189
I assume you mean
professionally rather than...

437
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,316
Just stop all
this carry-on.

438
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,567
If you can't talk to me,
you should talk to someone.

439
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,028
I suppose I should.

440
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,865
Enjoying yourselves?

441
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah, we are, yeah.

442
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,913
Lovely day.

443
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,957
It is in deed, yeah.

444
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,791
Stamps.

445
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:18,383
That's the future
of the priesthood.

446
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,897
Milo.

447
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,482
I need to speak to you,
Father.

448
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,986
Take a pew. Literally.

449
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,327
Why do people
kill themselves, Father?

450
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,373
"Why do people
kill themselves?"

451
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,709
That's jumping
in at the deep end.

452
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,211
Lots of reasons, I suppose.
Why do you think yourself?

453
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,338
I dunno.

454
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,674
Drink. Depression.

455
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,135
Lack of sex, maybe.

456
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,886
You're a presentable young man.

457
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,596
I wouldn't have thought
you'd have much trouble.

458
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:09,267
I don't have the gift of the gab.
Never had it.

459
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,893
That's making you feel suicidal?

460
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,603
More bored than anything else.

461
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:15,272
It's either committing
suicide or joining the Army.

462
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,692
Well those are pretty
drastic choices either way.

463
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,068
You can learn a trade
if you join the Army.

464
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,778
You can learn a trade
if you don't join the Army.

465
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,239
You can experience more of life.

466
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,325
You think you can become
a more authentic person

467
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,701
by fighting in a war?

468
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,827
By killing people?

469
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,747
You're against me joining the
Army, is what I'm sensing.

470
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,832
Well let's put it this way.

471
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,625
I've always felt there's
something psychopathic...

472
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,546
...about someone who joins
the Army in peacetime.

473
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,923
People join the Army
because they want

474
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,300
to find out what it's
like to kill someone.

475
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,302
I hardly think
that's an inclination

476
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,513
that should be encouraged
in modern society, do you?

477
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,809
Jesus Christ
didn't think so either.

478
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,314
And the commandment
'thou shalt not kill'

479
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,358
does not have
an asterisk beside it...

480
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,693
...referring you
to a footnote

481
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,070
where you'll find
a list of instances

482
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,529
where it's okay to kill people.

483
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,240
What about self-defense?

484
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,453
That's a tricky one
all right.

485
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,790
We're hardly being invaded,
though, are we?

486
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,541
The war on terror
has no borders.

487
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,795
I don't think Sligo is too high

488
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,047
on Al-Qaeda's agenda,
Milo, do you?

489
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,923
Who knows what goes on
in the Muslim mind?

490
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,553
I have had murderous feelings,
though, I have to admit.

491
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:30,138
Not getting laid.

492
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,308
It's starting to make me feel
really angry towards women.

493
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,019
And so I thought
if I join the Army,

494
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,314
those inclinations
would be seen as a plus.

495
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,650
On your application.

496
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,236
They don't come right out and say
that's what they're looking for.

497
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,072
In the advertisements it's all about
seeing the world and all that shite.

498
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,656
Wanting to murder
someone would be

499
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,241
like having
a degree in engineering.

500
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:52,327
It would outweigh my
lack of qualifications.

501
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:55,664
Right.

502
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,751
Do you use pornography at all?

503
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:02,422
I've exhausted all the
possibilities of pornography.

504
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,673
- All of them?
- Well, nearly all of them.

505
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,843
I'm on to transsexual
pornography at the moment.

506
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,430
Chicks with dicks,
you know?

507
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,189
Maybe there's
a simpler solution.

508
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,811
Leave home.

509
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,441
Go where your chances of
meeting women with loose morals

510
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,776
are increased proportionately.

511
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,528
Sligo town, do you mean?

512
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,864
No.

513
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:31,616
I was thinking more
Dublin, London, New York.

514
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:32,826
New York?

515
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,122
I'd only end up getting Aids
knowing my luck.

516
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,207
Thanks for taking the time
to talk to me, Father.

517
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,709
I can't say it's
been much help.

518
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,711
It's good to get these things
out in the open, I suppose.

519
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:58,777
FITZGERALD; Pull!

520
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,660
Pull!

521
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,960
Pull!

522
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,007
They've all
left me, you know.

523
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,218
That's why the place
is so empty.

524
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,929
Like a tomb.

525
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,680
Who's left you?

526
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,391
The wife. The kids.

527
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,894
Even Consuela,
and she's from Ecuador.

528
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,354
So you'd think
she wouldn't have

529
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,730
that many options,
but apparently not.

530
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,942
I'm sorry to hear that.

531
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,488
You mentioned
a financial proposition?

532
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,532
I'd like to make amends.

533
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,368
Do penance for past sins.

534
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,163
Although...
I suppose all sins are past,

535
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,792
otherwise they wouldn't be sins,
they'd just be...

536
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,713
...evil thoughts floating around
in your mind.

537
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,344
Why do you wear the auld soutane,
by the way?

538
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,597
Are you trying to make
a statement or something?

539
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:19,099
Look at this watch. Here.

540
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,519
That's making a statement.
That's a Tag Heuer. Very expensive.

541
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,605
Are you gonna get to the point, Mr.
Fitzgerald,

542
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,148
or are you just
going to ramble on?

543
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,983
Let me ask you a question.

544
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,985
What do you see
when you look at me?

545
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,239
I'll tell you what you see.

546
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,867
You see a handsome,
sophisticated,

547
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,619
eminent man in
the prime of his life.

548
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,746
A colossus, let's say.

549
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:46,293
A colossus who once bestrode
the world of high finance

550
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:51,215
...and became profoundly
influential in certain spheres...

551
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,010
...not to say
inordinately wealthy,

552
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,804
not to say sickeningly
wealthy, let's face it.

553
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,724
Are you sure I can't tempt you?

554
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,976
I'll stick to the water.

555
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:03,728
I heard you liked a drink.

556
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,146
I liked it too much.

557
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,190
There's no such
thing as too much.

558
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:13,320
There's only not enough!

559
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:15,989
Where was I?

560
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:17,782
Talking about money,
what else.

561
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,367
Now, now.

562
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:23,079
Got out in time, did you? Before
it all came crashing down?

563
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,041
It was the perfect
getaway, Father.

564
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,710
They say charges are going
to be filed against me

565
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,630
for various so-called
irregularities...

566
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:33,507
...but sure the Guards are always
threatening guff like that.

567
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,800
They'd have to
charge half the financiers

568
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:37,887
and half the bank managers
along with them...

569
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,889
...then troop into Government
and charge those cunts as well.

570
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,891
And that's not gonna happen.

571
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:48,648
No, there'll be no punishment
forthcoming for a man such as myself.

572
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,400
There never is.

573
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,780
Still, I do feel a modicum of
guilt about the whole thing.

574
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,407
A modicum. Do you?

575
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,492
Well...

576
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,496
...I feel like I ought
to feel guilty.

577
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,916
And isn't that the same thing?

578
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,086
I love this one.
Really expensive.

579
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,255
Not quite sure what it's
supposed to mean, though.

580
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,132
Why does it have
to mean anything?

581
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,260
Everything has to mean something,
otherwise what's the point?

582
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,306
Of course, I don't have
to know what it means.

583
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:24,599
I own it.
That's enough.

584
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,938
That's all that matters?
Ownership? Possession?

585
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,773
How much land does the Church own?
How much gold?

586
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,983
That's the Church,
that's not me.

587
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,737
You are a representative of
the Church, are you not?

588
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,030
If you say so.

589
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,364
I do say so, yes.

590
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,617
I think you're
a very judgmental man, Father.

591
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,994
Yes, I am.
But I try not to be.

592
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,746
You think I don't have any feelings?
You think I don't care...?

593
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:48,998
I think you don't want
to do penance at all.

594
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,543
I think you asked me here
to make fun of me.

595
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,963
But when you do want to
do penance, sincerely...

596
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,298
...you can give me a call,
at any time,

597
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,677
and I'll try my best
to help you.

598
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,972
I could piss on this,
you know.

599
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,143
I said I love it, I don't. It
doesn't mean anything to me.

600
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,728
I could take it down right
now and piss on it.

601
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,159
Do you want me to
do that, do you?

602
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:12,773
Why would I want
you to do that?!

603
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,315
I don't know.

604
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:18,653
So I can have some sort of
'spiritual revelation'?

605
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,949
Some sort of
fucking epiphany? Huh?

606
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,994
Okay. Let's go.
All right.

607
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,376
I'll give you an epiphany.

608
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,128
Well, I don't know now.

609
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,047
People like you have pissed on
everything else, I suppose,

610
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,009
so why not that, too?

611
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,032
You have your totems,
I see.

612
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,074
Who is it?

613
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:07,244
French couple. Head on.

614
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,456
She was totally unscathed.
He got fucked.

615
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,208
Wrong side of the road?

616
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,545
Car full of young ones hit them.
Drunk, of course.

617
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,088
How many?

618
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:20,925
5. And I'm
including the Frenchman.

619
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:22,885
Dear God.

620
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,387
Marine biologist he was.

621
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:29,057
That's where I'd like to be.
Under the sea.

622
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,851
Where are the young ones?

623
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,561
The morgue.
Best place for them.

624
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,233
Every life is sacred,
Frank, for God's sake.

625
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,860
Now, some are less
sacred than others.

626
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,250
Through this holy anointing...

627
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,460
...may the Lord in
His love and mercy

628
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,753
help you with
the grace of the Holy Spirit.

629
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,755
Amen.

630
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:12,141
May the Lord who
frees you from sin save you...

631
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,811
- ...and raise you up.
- Amen.

632
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:25,114
Have you performed
the Last Rites many times?

633
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,447
Yes.

634
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,952
Usually with older people,
of course.

635
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,873
You have time to prepare for it.

636
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,793
Everybody knows what's coming.

637
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,672
It is easier?

638
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,717
It's never easy.

639
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:48,094
More understandable,
let's say.

640
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,014
Less unfair.

641
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,976
Situations like this one...

642
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,811
...people are shocked.

643
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,315
The randomness of it.

644
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,650
They curse God.

645
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,987
Curse their fellow man.

646
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,155
They lose their faith
in some cases.

647
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,534
They lose their faith?

648
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:17,333
It must not have been
much of a faith to begin with,

649
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,918
if it is so easy
for them to lose it.

650
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,838
Yes, but...
but what is faith?

651
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:27,175
For most people it's the fear of death,
nothing more than that.

652
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:32,181
If that's all it is,
it's very easy to lose.

653
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,309
He was a good man,
your husband?

654
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,355
Yes.

655
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,652
He was a good man.

656
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:51,867
We had a very good life together.
We loved each other very much.

657
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,079
And now...

658
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,873
...he has gone.

659
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,043
And that is not unfair.

660
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,422
That is just what happened.

661
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,887
But many people...

662
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,597
don't live good lives.

663
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,353
They don't feel love.

664
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,567
That is what is unfair.

665
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,030
I feel sorry for them.

666
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,911
Will you say
a prayer with me, Teresa?

667
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,918
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

668
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,755
Blessed art thou
amongst women.

669
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,050
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

670
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,762
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

671
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:57,224
...now and at
the hour of our death. Amen.

672
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,112
Finished with all
your gobbledegook?

673
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,409
How is she holding up?

674
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,038
She's a strong woman.

675
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:20,456
Good-looking, too.

676
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:22,623
I could be in there.

677
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,418
I have a thing for widows.

678
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,295
Did I ever tell you?

679
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:29,797
I think you might have done.

680
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,509
Your material is getting
a little stale after all.

681
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:36,637
The atheistic doctor,
it's a clichéd part to play.

682
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,474
There aren't that
many good lines.

683
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:44,480
One part humanism
to nine parts gallows humor.

684
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:47,356
Playing you, though, now...

685
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:49,860
that might be interesting.

686
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,987
Playing me. Who's 'me'?

687
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:54,072
The good priest.

688
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:00,704
Excuse me, won't you.

689
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,998
I have to go kill somebody.

690
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:25,360
How long was I out?

691
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:29,525
Ages. Eons.

692
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,141
Did I ever tell you the story
about Fionn Mac Cumhaill...

693
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,822
...and another big strong lad
called Cicsatoin?

694
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,065
They were up at the top of...

695
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,201
They were at the top
of the Ox Mountains.

696
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:42,101
Cicsatoin challenged Fionn to throw
a boulder into the sea at Easkey,

697
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,789
claiming that he couldn't do it.

698
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,541
Fionn accepted the challenge.

699
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,210
Cicsatoin's boulder
landed on the shore...

700
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,628
...creating such waves that the
sea has not been the same since...

701
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,840
...which is why
the Easkey coastline

702
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,050
is internationally
renowned for its surfing.

703
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,391
Fionn's boulder landed short.
Landed here.

704
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,972
He drew his sword. Split the rock in two.
And it's said...

705
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,474
...that should
someone be foolhardy

706
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:03,976
enough to pass
through the rock 3 times

707
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:06,728
...they will be squished
into tiny little lumps.

708
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,105
Unceremoniously.

709
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:14,402
Not a lot of poetry in that recital.
Not a lot of romance.

710
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,697
I'm sick to death of romance.

711
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:23,077
There was a Japanese writer,
committed suicide.

712
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,416
He wrote out
a list beforehand of

713
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,793
all the famous suicides
throughout history.

714
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,628
He included Christ.

715
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,547
Sounds like a smartarse.

716
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,427
In the Middle Ages they would have
said I was possessed by demons.

717
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,096
Maybe you were.

718
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:44,105
<i>Maybe they were nearer
the mark back then.</i>

719
00:44:44,141 --> 00:44:47,476
You think what happened
was unimportant.

720
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,440
Insignificant in
the great scheme of things.

721
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,108
To provoke such a reaction.

722
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,820
But what may...

723
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:06,914
But what may mean nothing to you
may be very important to me.

724
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:09,833
I'd never say it was unimportant.

725
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:15,297
I'd just say the choices you
make when you're 30...

726
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,090
...are not the same choices
you make when you're 60.

727
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:20,092
That's irrelevant.

728
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,306
Every moment of living has its
own logic, its own meaning.

729
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,974
Maybe so.

730
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:30,938
Maybe you're right there.
I'll have to think about that.

731
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,110
It's a tired old argument,
I suppose.

732
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,655
But what about
those you leave behind?

733
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:44,159
I belong to myself,
not to anybody else.

734
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:45,786
True.

735
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,456
False.

736
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,128
You'll tell me it would have
been a mortal sin, I suppose.

737
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,719
Would I have suffered
eternal damnation, Father?

738
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,811
God is great.

739
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:15,231
The limits of His mercy
have not been set.

740
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,447
Is this where you
want to be buried?

741
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:25,867
Why in hell
would I want to be buried

742
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,327
in a God-forsaken
place like this?

743
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:33,416
Where then? Père Lachaise?
Next to dear old Oscar?

744
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:37,170
No. Next to Apollinaire
and Max Ophüls.

745
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,380
Oh, very fancy,
I must say.

746
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,257
I have your gun for you,
by the way.

747
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:42,509
Yeah, right.

748
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:43,885
I do so.

749
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,847
Webley. Circa 1920.
Still in good working order, though.

750
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,516
Or so I've been told
by a man who would know.

751
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,893
Well, hand it over, then.

752
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,269
I don't have it on me.

753
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:57,065
I knew it. Worried I might
follow through with it, huh?

754
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,358
You might take a potshot
at me, for all I know.

755
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:01,570
Why would I do that?
What have you

756
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:03,864
ever done to me
except talk garbage?

757
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:05,740
That doesn't mean anything.

758
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,295
Bloody idiots can't
even be bothered

759
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,827
coming up with a reason
for murder these days.

760
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,789
Wake up in a foul mood
and it's bang bang bang.

761
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:17,126
Oh, I don't know about that. Some
people have very good reasons.

762
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,675
Which of the lads
are you here to see, Father?

763
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,969
Freddie Joyce.

764
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,847
Freddie Joyce. He m...

765
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,432
I know who he is.

766
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,393
What in the hell do
you wanna see him for?

767
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,436
He's an old pupil of mine.
He asked to see me.

768
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,864
You know I've
asked them to hang me.

769
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,284
There's no capital punishment in
Ireland, Freddie, as you well know.

770
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,411
Why do you want
them to hang you?

771
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,204
Because that's
the way Lesley Ryan died.

772
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:54,623
Are you saying
you feel remorse?

773
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:57,458
I'm not a monster.
Do I look like a monster?

774
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,213
What do monsters look like?

775
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,882
I had the cops in here
the other day.

776
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:10,472
The third degree. Wanting to
go over all the gory details.

777
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:14,226
Which I'm sure you were
only too happy to provide.

778
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:16,394
They're obsessed
with cannibalism.

779
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,188
"What did it taste like?"

780
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:24,068
I told them it tasted like pheasant.
A bit gamey.

781
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:28,030
Good for you.
Make a joke about it.

782
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,702
Why were they...?
It's the same as always.

783
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:35,789
They wanna know
where the last one is.

784
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,668
The one they never found.
The one I connected up.

785
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,675
Why can't you
tell them, Freddie?

786
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,094
Give the family
some kind of peace.

787
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,181
I wanted to, Father, but...

788
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:57,853
...for the life of me I cannot
remember where I put it.

789
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,813
I know it was in
the woods somewhere.

790
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:00,958
Where did I leave my keys?

791
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,358
No! I wasn't in
my right mind.

792
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,153
You know, LSD. It was like a...
fairytale.

793
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:11,740
You said all that at the trial, Freddie.
Getting kind of tiresome now.

794
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:15,911
She was a lovely...

795
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,375
...she was a lovely girl.

796
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:24,628
You know she told me
that she'd been abused before.

797
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,215
So I says, "Well, once more
won't make any difference then".

798
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:38,768
You see the light go
out in their eyes...

799
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,103
and you become God.

800
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,981
No you don't!

801
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,777
No- you- don't.

802
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,615
Why am I here?!

803
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,246
I just wanted
someone to talk to.

804
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,083
I don't think you
feel any guilt whatsoever

805
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:06,003
about anything
that you've done.

806
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,672
No, I do. I do, Father.

807
00:50:11,635 --> 00:50:13,969
I believe what
the Bible teaches.

808
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:18,224
I believe that if I repent my sins
that I'll be forgiven...

809
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,829
...and I'll be able
to go up to Heaven

810
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:23,103
and I'll see those girls and
I'll tell them how sorry I am.

811
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:25,940
And I'll hug them
and I'll kiss them

812
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,443
and I'll love them
with a real true love...

813
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:31,570
...and I'll have no desire
to hurt them in any way.

814
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:39,663
God made me, didn't he?

815
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,916
I mean, didn't he?

816
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,920
So he understands me.

817
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:50,465
He must do.

818
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,972
Don't you think?

819
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,018
I think if God
can't understand you, Freddie...

820
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:07,065
...no-one can.

821
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,659
You know they're
foreclosing on me.

822
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:18,994
Who?

823
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,746
The banks. Who else?

824
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,581
Sorry to hear that.

825
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,164
How come I never hear your
mob preaching about that?

826
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,626
About what?

827
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,422
All these bankers that have
brought the country to its knees.

828
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:36,177
Still throwing people out of their
homes for not making their payments.

829
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,014
I never hear your mob
talking about that.

830
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:41,141
Those are sins,
too, aren't they?

831
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,934
Yes, they are.

832
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:46,353
I suppose... when
you've a history of

833
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,315
screwing the Jews
out of their money...

834
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,608
...and collaborating
with the Nazis,

835
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:53,027
it's like the
pot calling the kettle black, huh?

836
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:55,530
I suppose it is.

837
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,271
Getting full use out of your
library card there, Brendan.

838
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:01,577
The library's been shut down.
Did you not hear?

839
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,204
Cutbacks.

840
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:30,440
You not dancing, Milo?

841
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,442
I don't like this music.

842
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,735
What music do you like?

843
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:36,655
Dolly Parton.

844
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,449
Dolly Parton's good, yeah.

845
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,750
Great cocaine.

846
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:52,003
Very moreish.

847
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,260
Purely medicinal, Father.

848
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,146
How was your man Joyce?

849
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:15,025
It's been a tough day,
let's put it that way.

850
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:18,195
How can you hope to connect
with someone like that?

851
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,532
Who are you talking about?
Not Freddie Joyce?

852
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,659
I visited him in prison today.

853
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:24,994
Why?

854
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,996
Prisoners deserve spiritual guidance
as much as anyone else.

855
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:29,123
Maybe more so.

856
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,626
Is that right?
So they can find God...

857
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:37,507
...and then say God has absolved them
of all their sins...

858
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,264
...and what they did
didn't really matter

859
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:40,969
anyways because
now they're saved?

860
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:42,302
Something like that, yeah.

861
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,389
Calm down. You don't know
what you're talking about.

862
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,940
Would you mind the drinks!
For Christ's sake!

863
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:59,903
He's had that coming a long time.
You know yourself.

864
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,500
Fine-looking man.

865
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,461
I'd watch yourself around him.

866
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,797
I gave up cocaine
a long time ago.

867
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:22,092
You took cocaine?

868
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:24,679
Come on. Let's dance.

869
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:29,641
What did they call it
in your day, jive? Come on.

870
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,927
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

871
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,347
Say one Our Father
and ten Hail Marys.

872
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,349
I've sinned more than that.

873
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,561
Make an ascent of Croagh Patrick, then,
on your knees.

874
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,105
On my knees, is it?

875
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,106
What made you say that?

876
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,451
Your church is on fire.

877
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,161
Fuck off, Brendan,
I'm not in the mood.

878
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,704
Your church is on fire!

879
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,170
Jesus Christ.

880
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,231
I've called the fire brigade, Father.

881
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:49,179
For all the good it'll do.

882
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,349
They'll never get here in time.

883
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:56,771
Why didn't anybody see?

884
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,606
Daddy, stay away.

885
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,360
Daddy, come away!

886
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:05,280
Why didn't anybody see?

887
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:15,623
They're probably
gonna blame you for this.

888
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:24,965
Professional job.
I'll say that for them.

889
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,010
Any fool can start a fire,
for fuck's sake.

890
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,030
Who would do
a thing like this?

891
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:52,076
Somebody with a grudge
against the Church, obviously.

892
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,827
That could be half the country.

893
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:56,414
Unless there's a personal angle.

894
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:57,498
How do you mean?

895
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,001
Nobody with a grudge
against you, Father, no?

896
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:03,963
Who would have
a grudge against you?

897
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,840
Maybe this is the future, huh?

898
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:10,260
Maybe it'll all
be ruins one day.

899
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,306
Maybe one day kids will say
to their parents in amazement,

900
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:15,182
they used to believe in what?

901
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:17,309
An auld lad
up in the sky?

902
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,103
And if we're good
we'll go to Heaven?

903
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:20,938
And if we're bad
we'll go to Hell?

904
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,983
You know for a policeman
you seem to

905
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,777
know very little
about human nature.

906
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,155
Maybe you're right.
You'd know more than me.

907
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,577
But don't touch anything now.
I'll have to get the forensic boys down...

908
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,704
...the supercilious pricks.

909
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:47,255
What do we do now?

910
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,717
We'll have to rebuild it,
I suppose.

911
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:55,514
Maybe use bricks next time.
Might be a good idea.

912
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,655
Ah God, Father.

913
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:17,911
Is this about the coke?
I can take it or leave it.

914
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,039
Really?

915
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,666
Yeah. Most people can.

916
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,503
The only ones who can't
had problems to begin with.

917
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,422
We shouldn't write
them off, though,

918
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,717
the ones with problems
to begin with.

919
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,637
What do you want to do
with your life, Veronica?

920
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:39,851
Nothing.

921
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,353
'Consider the lilies of the field,
how they grow

922
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,898
'They toil not,
neither do they spin.'

923
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,983
Very nice quotation.

924
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,068
Ah sure, everybody
knows that one.

925
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,695
It's hackneyed, yeah.

926
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,282
Like 'turn the other cheek'
or 'judge not, lest ye be judged'.

927
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,871
I'd like to be
an actress, maybe.

928
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:02,331
I've an absent father
and a domineering mother.

929
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,666
That's a start.

930
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:06,878
When did your dad leave?

931
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,797
He didn't leave,
he was killed.

932
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:12,632
Murdered?!

933
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:14,217
Hunting accident.

934
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,429
Completely random.

935
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:21,726
So there's no use persevering, Father.
I'm a lost cause.

936
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,105
No-one is a lost cause,
Veronica.

937
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,652
Who is it?

938
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:36,490
I don't know who it is.

939
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,579
You said you did.

940
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,331
I have no evidence
it's the same man.

941
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,250
It's the same man.

942
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,670
Takes a lot of nerve
to burn down a church.

943
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:53,507
Helps if you have a burning sense
of grievance,

944
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,259
if you'll pardon the...

945
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:59,514
We have to ask ourselves,
what does this man want?

946
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:04,601
Well, he wants to be loved, of course.
We all want to be loved.

947
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,856
Failing that,
he wants to be... admired.

948
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,943
Failing that,
he wants to be feared.

949
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,114
Failing that, he wants to
be hated and despised.

950
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,407
We should beware
the man who wants to

951
01:00:19,534 --> 01:00:21,702
be hated and despised.
Don't you think?

952
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:27,166
I think you read that in
a book, Your Excellency.

953
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:32,045
I think he wants to
stir up some sort of

954
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,340
feeling in others,
that's true.

955
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,885
Doesn't want to be
ignored any more.

956
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,887
Wants to make contact.

957
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,349
He made contact
all right.

958
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,063
Who is it?

959
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:56,737
Dreadful business,
I must say.

960
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,739
Some little blackguard running
riot, I wouldn't wonder.

961
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,577
What can you do in
this day and age?

962
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:04,202
True dat.

963
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:08,583
Sorry about
the other day, Father.

964
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,835
That was the drink talking.

965
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,753
What can we do for you?

966
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,088
It's off the back
of what I was saying.

967
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,592
And it seems more
necessary now than ever.

968
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:18,885
I'd like to make a donation.

969
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,760
Oh!

970
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,599
That would be grand.

971
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,224
To salve your conscience?

972
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,686
Surely that's in the nature
of all philanthropy.

973
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,396
The expiation of guilt.

974
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:33,940
I'm sure you've nothing major to
feel guilty about, Mr. Fitzgerald.

975
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,778
Oh, you'd be surprised, Father.
Call me Michael.

976
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:45,119
Michael it is. Any charity is
always gratefully received.

977
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:46,119
I know.

978
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,914
I believe that's
Church doctrine.

979
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,043
We all know the Church needs
all the help it can get,

980
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:53,460
especially these days.

981
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:55,588
Why would you say that?

982
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,130
Well, with all the compensation
that's been paid out

983
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,632
over the last few years.

984
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,070
And that's only the Yanks. And we
all know they weren't the worst.

985
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,974
I don't know about that, now.

986
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,768
And most of those cases
were 40 or 50 years ago.

987
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,396
Raking up old ground
it always seemed to me.

988
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,567
Time to forgive and forget.
I agree, I agree.

989
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:20,278
What's past is past.
Time to move on.

990
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,782
Et cetera, et cetera.

991
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:29,413
Would you like a cup of tea, Michael,
or maybe something stronger?

992
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,581
Do you have any crystal meth?

993
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:33,708
No, no, I can't stop.

994
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:36,170
So what are
we talking about? 10?

995
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:37,922
20?

996
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,173
20,000?

997
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,677
20,000 euros, yeah.

998
01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:46,806
Well, that would be grand.

999
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,581
That would help with getting the
initial building work off the ground.

1000
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,436
20 it is then.

1001
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,605
This is a David Oscarson pen.

1002
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,733
It's really expensive.

1003
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,277
Oh, it's lovely.

1004
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,945
Why not make it 50?

1005
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,114
Ah now, Father.

1006
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:09,036
If money's no object,
make it 50.

1007
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:14,333
Why not make it 100?
It means nothing to me.

1008
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,378
I know it doesn't.

1009
01:03:19,297 --> 01:03:22,882
100,000 euros for your pet project, Father.
What do you say to that?

1010
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:25,719
I say thank you,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

1011
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,724
What was Stanton getting at?

1012
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,893
If I could tell you I would.
You know that.

1013
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:36,563
I thought I was the one supposed
to be in trouble, not you.

1014
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,233
How's the fish?

1015
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,902
Too many little bones.

1016
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:44,572
Isn't that always the way.

1017
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:46,740
I'm not stopping.

1018
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,242
Meeting the fella.

1019
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,704
You're informing me of
your adultery in advance?

1020
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,831
Isn't that more honest
than in the confessional

1021
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,751
when it's all done and dusted...

1022
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,418
...and there's nothing
you can do about it?

1023
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,920
What are you expecting
him to do about it?

1024
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,880
Stop me from committing
a mortal sin.

1025
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,425
You have to stop yourself.
I can't stop you.

1026
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,510
Then what good are you at all?

1027
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,264
There's my ride, as it were.

1028
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:15,018
Let's do this again sometime.

1029
01:04:22,193 --> 01:04:25,028
Do you have to put up with that
kind of shit on a regular basis?

1030
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,617
There's a lot of it going
around, let's put it that way.

1031
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:38,626
We really should
talk, you know. Get it all out.

1032
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,963
Like in one of those
shit plays at the Abbey?

1033
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:48,094
I don't know what the third act
revelation would be, though.

1034
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:50,096
Neither do I.

1035
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:56,768
Your mother dying killed a little
something in both of us, I know that.

1036
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,106
It was a long goodbye
if ever there was one.

1037
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,985
Sometimes I wish she hadn't have
hung on as long as she did.

1038
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,612
She was stubborn,
all right.

1039
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:09,824
Brave, too, though.

1040
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:13,159
Wonder if I'll be as brave
when the time comes.

1041
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,121
It wasn't just her dying.

1042
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:20,501
You were missing in action a long time.
Before and after.

1043
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,838
When I needed you most.

1044
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,300
I was never neglectful,
I don't think.

1045
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,054
I never hit you or anything.

1046
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:34,181
There are other forms
of violence.

1047
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:37,809
I know there are.
Attempting suicide, for one.

1048
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,353
Jesus. I walked
into that one.

1049
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,398
It's not only violence
against yourself, either.

1050
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,608
It wasn't intended that way.

1051
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,360
I never meant to hurt you.

1052
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,489
How could it not hurt me?
I love you.

1053
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,490
I love you, too.

1054
01:05:53,451 --> 01:05:55,202
Don't ever doubt that.

1055
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,126
But, Dad...

1056
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,838
Dad, just when I thought
I had you back...

1057
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:11,050
and you were shipshape and raring to go,
go you did.

1058
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,806
I thought it would
be another woman.

1059
01:06:16,474 --> 01:06:19,476
Fiona, I have a vocation.
I wasn't trying to escape.

1060
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,561
I know that.
I know you're sincere.

1061
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,065
But, Dad,
the fact remains...

1062
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,030
...first mum went away
and then you went away.

1063
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:35,951
And I lost two parents
for the price of one.

1064
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:42,123
I never went anywhere.
I'm still here.

1065
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,626
I think you're being
a bit naive, there, Father.

1066
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,253
I'm still here.

1067
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,588
I'll always be here.

1068
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,592
Will you?

1069
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,637
You promise?

1070
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,726
I'll always be here.

1071
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,438
And you'll always be here.

1072
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:20,161
How's that for
a third act revelation?

1073
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:22,289
It's corny.

1074
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,583
But I like it.

1075
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,228
Here.

1076
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:44,269
<i>As long as there is
chicken gravy on your rice</i>

1077
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,563
<i>Everything is nice</i>

1078
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,275
Here's mud in your eye.

1079
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,153
Great stuff!

1080
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:04,831
You know how you can tell when
you're really getting old?

1081
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,500
How?

1082
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:12,505
No-one ever says the word
'death' around you anymore.

1083
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:17,927
Bruno.

1084
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:21,765
Bruno.

1085
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,198
Oh, Bruno.

1086
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:44,496
What has he done to you, Bruno?

1087
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,729
I forgot to say
goodbye to Bruno.

1088
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,215
I'll give him a big kiss from you.

1089
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,483
Oh, do.

1090
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,859
I'll be fine, you know.

1091
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:15,234
Will you?

1092
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:19,489
Well, let's just say,
today I'm fine.

1093
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,408
So you say.

1094
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:50,104
Hello.

1095
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,521
Where are you off to?

1096
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,439
The beach.

1097
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,775
It's nice at the beach, isn't it?
Yeah.

1098
01:09:55,943 --> 01:09:57,110
Do you surf?

1099
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:00,530
No, my Da won't let me.
Says it's too dangerous.

1100
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:04,409
What does he know?
Big meanie.

1101
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:07,453
Are you here on holidays?

1102
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,974
Where are you from?
Wicklow?

1103
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,088
Yeah.

1104
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:12,292
Never mind.
We won't hold it against you.

1105
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,462
Janine! Get in the car.

1106
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,716
What were you saying to her?

1107
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:21,346
I wasn't saying anything to her.
Oh, really?

1108
01:10:21,385 --> 01:10:24,304
You looked deep
in fucking conversation to me!

1109
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,976
Where the hell did
you get to, honey?

1110
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:32,145
I've been looking
all over for you.

1111
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:45,576
Large one.

1112
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,162
Are you sure about that?

1113
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,247
Whiskey, I said.

1114
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,756
Who burned down your church, Father?
If you don't mind me asking.

1115
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,507
It's not my church.

1116
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,094
It's our church.

1117
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:08,931
I'd say it was the Romanians.
They're awful heathens, the Romanians.

1118
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,103
What Romanians do
we have around here?

1119
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,189
They're always hanging around,
Romanians.

1120
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:17,940
Getting up to no good.

1121
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,694
Must be someone
who doesn't like you, Father.

1122
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:24,030
I think it must be one
of the good people in this town.

1123
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:28,702
You should join the Guards, Simon,
with your powers of deduction.

1124
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:45,051
These measures, Father. Like a
buttercup in the mouth of a cow.

1125
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,555
Pint there, please, Brendan.

1126
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,478
So you're sure there's a God, then,
Father, yeah?

1127
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:02,569
Hey, I'm not codding.

1128
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:08,324
I'm being serious.
I'm asking because I'm having doubts myself.

1129
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:11,662
I'm having a crisis of faith.

1130
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:16,166
Don't be getting offended.

1131
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,088
I'm sorry.
Really I am!

1132
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:26,717
As sure as there's a hole in a goat.
Don't be going away mad.

1133
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:32,474
I'm an awful messer.

1134
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:37,270
<i>One scotch, one bourbon</i>

1135
01:12:37,688 --> 01:12:40,106
Hey, Fada. Whaddaya hear,
whaddaya say.

1136
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,942
You're back?

1137
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:44,278
I got a lotta clients
in this town, Fada.

1138
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,738
From the hoi polloi
to the masses of society.

1139
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:50,449
I gotta keep my ass
lubricated at all times.

1140
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,578
The hoi polloi are
the masses of society.

1141
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,538
You're using
the phrase incorrectly.

1142
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,166
You know,
that may be so, Fada.

1143
01:12:58,292 --> 01:12:59,917
I didn't get no education, see.

1144
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,212
I was getting fucked in the ass
and in the face all day long.

1145
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,215
There wasn't time
for any book-learning.

1146
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,759
I was sucking
the prick of a bishop

1147
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:10,554
in his bishopric
on a regular basis.

1148
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,765
How do you like
that play on words, smartass?

1149
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,641
Do you need help?

1150
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:19,061
You're starting to
sound a little screwy.

1151
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,648
Maybe you need to see
a head shrinker yourself.

1152
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,649
Do you need help?
Are you okay?

1153
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:25,569
Hey! Fada!

1154
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,157
There's nothing wrong with me, Fada.
All right?

1155
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:33,993
I'm feeling fine.

1156
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,755
You know...

1157
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:49,259
...when I first started out,
working up in Dublin...

1158
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,845
...there was
this 3 year old boy.

1159
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:58,185
Parents brought him into the hospital,
a routine operation.

1160
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:02,439
But the anesthetist,
he made a mistake.

1161
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:06,609
The little boy ended up deaf...

1162
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:10,363
...dumb... blind...

1163
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,701
...and paralyzed.
For good.

1164
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:19,872
Think of it.

1165
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:24,336
Think of when that little boy
first regained consciousness.

1166
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,380
In the dark.

1167
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,048
You'd be frightened,
wouldn't you?

1168
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:32,551
But you'd be frightened

1169
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:36,806
in the kind of a way that you know
that the fear is going to end.

1170
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,725
It has to.

1171
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:41,728
It must.

1172
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:44,855
Your parents couldn't
be too far away.

1173
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,734
They'll come to your rescue.

1174
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:52,322
They'll turn the light on
and they'll talk to you.

1175
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,701
But, think of it.

1176
01:14:57,536 --> 01:14:59,537
Nobody comes to rescue you.

1177
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,707
No light is turned on.

1178
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:06,252
You are in the dark.

1179
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,256
You try to speak
but you can't.

1180
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,092
You try to move...

1181
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,429
but you can't.

1182
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:18,556
You try to cry out

1183
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:22,394
but you are unable
to hear your own screams.

1184
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:26,480
You are entombed
within your own body

1185
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,110
...howling with terror.

1186
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,456
What the fuck?

1187
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,501
Why the fuck would you tell me
a story like that?

1188
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:49,296
No reason.

1189
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:02,475
Some people
are awful touchy.

1190
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:05,686
Good luck now!

1191
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,957
<i>Babe, you can't hold me</i>

1192
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:29,502
<i>I'm too slippery</i>

1193
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,755
<i>I do no sleeping</i>

1194
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,381
<i>I get lonely</i>

1195
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:39,637
<i>But you can touch me
if you want to</i>

1196
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,349
<i>But I got poison</i>

1197
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,850
<i>I just might bite you</i>

1198
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:51,565
<i>Lie in circles
on the sunlight</i>

1199
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,653
<i>Shine like diamonds</i>

1200
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,363
It's time to go.
Come on.

1201
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,242
He's still drinking.
Same here.

1202
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,327
Time to go, I said.

1203
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,288
What's that, an order?

1204
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,416
You do not like
taking orders, Father?

1205
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,836
You don't mind
giving them.

1206
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,046
His kind are all alike.

1207
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,672
My 'kind'.

1208
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:17,091
Yeah, your 'kind'.

1209
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,511
Your time has gone,
you don't even fucking realize it.

1210
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:22,346
My time will never be gone.

1211
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,266
Did you hear that?
The arrogance of the man.

1212
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,185
You need to be a little
more humble, Father.

1213
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:30,939
Needs taking down a peg or two.

1214
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:39,780
Take me down then.

1215
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:44,077
Go on.
I fucking dare you.

1216
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:21,573
Jesus Christ.

1217
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:22,823
What happened to you?

1218
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:23,949
Brendan Lynch.

1219
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,953
Brendan Lynch?
He's a Buddhist.

1220
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:29,497
So what if he's
a fucking Buddhist?!

1221
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,917
You think Buddhists
don't beat people up?!

1222
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,252
You think Buddhists
don't fuck their kids like everyone else?

1223
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:35,837
Well, you're obviously
very upset.

1224
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:37,963
Tibetans spit on blind
people in the street!

1225
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:40,091
They're killing albinos
in Africa!

1226
01:18:40,175 --> 01:18:41,676
You're so fucking naive!

1227
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:43,345
Please don't
curse at me, Father.

1228
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:47,306
We'll continue in the
morning when you're sober.

1229
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,310
Why are you
a fucking priest at all?!

1230
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:54,271
You should be a fucking
accountant in an insurance firm!

1231
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:11,664
Dirty thing.

1232
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,127
Let's go home.

1233
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,463
What is it?

1234
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,048
Nothing.

1235
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:43,654
You're leaving?

1236
01:19:47,492 --> 01:19:48,868
I think it's for the best.

1237
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:50,369
Because of last night?

1238
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:52,747
Because of a lot of things.

1239
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:57,002
Not just last night,
or what's happened here.

1240
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,256
I've been having doubts,
if you must know.

1241
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,051
Listen, I'm sorry
about what I said last night.

1242
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,679
You said what you said
with such venom.

1243
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:09,805
I didn't realize
you hated me that much.

1244
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:11,515
I don't hate you at all.

1245
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:13,851
Then why?

1246
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,354
It's just you have no integrity.

1247
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:18,814
That's the worst thing
I could say about anybody.

1248
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,902
Well, that's...

1249
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:26,072
...that's just...

1250
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:28,240
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

1251
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:29,951
Good luck.

1252
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:48,386
<i>Everybody talks about
a new world in the morning</i>

1253
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:53,766
<i>A new world in the morning
so they say</i>

1254
01:20:54,809 --> 01:21:00,064
<i>I myself don't talk about
a new world in the morning</i>

1255
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:04,694
<i>A new world in the morning
that's today</i>

1256
01:21:05,403 --> 01:21:10,449
<i>And I can feel
a new tomorrow coming on</i>

1257
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:17,122
<i>And I don't know why
I have to make a song</i>

1258
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:23,003
<i>Everybody talks about
a new world in the morning</i>

1259
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:27,966
<i>New world in the morning
takes so long</i>

1260
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,309
Father?

1261
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:38,185
Hello.

1262
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:43,024
You are going to Dublin?

1263
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,653
Yeah.

1264
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,948
Just getting away
for a while, you know.

1265
01:21:52,826 --> 01:21:56,037
I heard about your church.
A terrible thing.

1266
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:58,539
Yes.

1267
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:01,626
You must be very upset.

1268
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:08,298
Yes, I am.

1269
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,685
I'm bringing him home...
to his family in Italy.

1270
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:24,858
Dublin and then... Rome.

1271
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:28,944
How have you been?

1272
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:31,780
People here have
been very kind to me.

1273
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,283
No, I mean...

1274
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:39,831
You know...

1275
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:43,208
sometimes I think
I cannot go on.

1276
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,378
But...

1277
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,882
...I will go on.

1278
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:22,034
Father.

1279
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:24,162
Little early for Mass.

1280
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:27,832
Doctor Harte was out fishing
at the crack of dawn.

1281
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:30,417
He begrudgingly
gave me a ride.

1282
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,462
Where are you headed?

1283
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,047
Just down the beach.

1284
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,632
Can I come along?

1285
01:25:36,841 --> 01:25:39,469
Not really, no.
Maybe later.

1286
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:43,389
That's fine. You know,
I don't wanna keep you.

1287
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:45,891
Did you finish your book?

1288
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:48,019
Yes, I did. I don't
know how good it is.

1289
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,105
I'm sure it'll be extraordinary.
You're a very fine writer.

1290
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,778
Thank you, James.

1291
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,323
<i>You know you
changed the subject</i>

1292
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:02,837
<i>the other day
when we were talking?</i>

1293
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:04,577
What was the subject?

1294
01:26:04,661 --> 01:26:06,746
You know what the subject was.

1295
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:09,131
I think you committed
a sin of omission there,

1296
01:26:09,157 --> 01:26:10,341
if truth be told.

1297
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:13,418
Sure there are worse sins
than sins of omission.

1298
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,921
Well now you'd be the expert
in that department, Father.

1299
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:19,926
I think there's too much talk about sins,
to be honest...

1300
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:22,427
...and not enough
talk about virtues.

1301
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,930
You might be right.

1302
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,350
What would be
your number one?

1303
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:32,063
I think forgiveness has
been highly underrated.

1304
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,900
I forgive you.

1305
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,529
Do you forgive me?

1306
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,198
Always.

1307
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,471
Thinking of
throwing yourself in?

1308
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,640
They say that's
the easy way out.

1309
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,894
Nothing easy about it,
I wouldn't have thought.

1310
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:17,984
I'm in a bad way, Father.

1311
01:27:20,737 --> 01:27:22,779
No, I'm not putting you on.

1312
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,908
The truth is,
I've been in a bad way for...

1313
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:29,996
...a long time.

1314
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:33,623
Not wanting
to do anything.

1315
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:37,587
Feeling of nothing
being worthwhile.

1316
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:42,007
A sense of disassociation.

1317
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,344
Detachment.

1318
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:47,846
I had a wife and kids...

1319
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,184
...they meant nothing to me.

1320
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:58,190
I have money,
it means nothing to me.

1321
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,944
I have life...

1322
01:28:03,863 --> 01:28:05,823
...it means nothing to me.

1323
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,913
Where do you think
it comes from...

1324
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:14,916
the sense of detachment?

1325
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,380
From nowhere.

1326
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:26,551
From nowhere.

1327
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:35,435
Listen, I've to meet
someone now...

1328
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:38,396
...but I'll call up
to the house after.

1329
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,775
We'll talk.

1330
01:28:44,862 --> 01:28:47,198
Get you back on track.
Okay?

1331
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:54,997
- Okay?
- Thank you.

1332
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,583
Thank you, Father.

1333
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,336
Thank you.

1334
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:01,503
All right?

1335
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,716
Are you all right?
Yeah.

1336
01:30:02,273 --> 01:30:05,484
Take your hands out of your pockets.
Slowly.

1337
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:07,444
Why?

1338
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:09,279
I heard you had a gun.

1339
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,954
I have to say I'm surprised. Thought
I'd have to go looking for you.

1340
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,081
Just because I'm here,
doesn't mean

1341
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,207
you have to go
through with it.

1342
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:21,958
Yes, it does.

1343
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:26,087
It's one of those
self-fulfilling prophecies.

1344
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:30,134
Did you ever think it would
come to this, though?

1345
01:30:30,384 --> 01:30:33,762
I was hoping it wouldn't. I thought
you were a friend of mine.

1346
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:36,097
A friend is just an enemy
you haven't made yet.

1347
01:30:37,475 --> 01:30:40,728
Cheap cynicism.
Not cheap, now, no.

1348
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:44,564
That's a cynicism
that's been hard won.

1349
01:30:45,274 --> 01:30:47,652
That's a cynicism
that's been earned...

1350
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:51,613
...after a hell of a lot of
physical and psychological torture.

1351
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:55,784
I take it back, then. But
it's cynicism nonetheless.

1352
01:30:57,453 --> 01:30:59,204
Maybe that's
the difference between us.

1353
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,082
Oh, that's not
the only difference.

1354
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:04,585
Any regrets?

1355
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:08,088
I have, yeah. I never got
to finish <i>Moby Dick.</i>

1356
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,091
The whale kills Ahab.
Is that right?

1357
01:31:10,216 --> 01:31:13,802
Then he destroys the rest of the
ship and the crew along with it.

1358
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:19,432
All except for Ishmael. He
alone escapes to tell thee.

1359
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:26,399
The burning of the
church I can understand.

1360
01:31:29,193 --> 01:31:31,194
You didn't have
to kill my dog.

1361
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:33,572
I didn't kill your dog.
I love dogs.

1362
01:31:33,698 --> 01:31:35,533
Why would I do
a thing like that?

1363
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:37,158
I found him with his throat cut.

1364
01:31:37,243 --> 01:31:40,203
Why would I fucking
kill a dog?! I didn't...

1365
01:31:40,496 --> 01:31:42,163
That was nothing to do with me.

1366
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,085
I am wholly innocent
of that crime.

1367
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:53,175
I did give Veronica a bit
of a shove that one time.

1368
01:31:53,259 --> 01:31:56,761
I do admit that
and I'm sorry for it.

1369
01:32:01,559 --> 01:32:03,601
Did it upset you,
the dog?

1370
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:05,604
Yes, it did.

1371
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,230
Did you cry?

1372
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,024
Yes, I did.

1373
01:32:09,108 --> 01:32:10,775
That's nice.

1374
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,280
When you read what
your fellow priests

1375
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:17,033
did to all those
poor children...

1376
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:19,118
...over the years,
did you cry then?

1377
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:26,292
I asked you a question.
Did you cry then?

1378
01:32:27,626 --> 01:32:28,877
No.

1379
01:32:29,462 --> 01:32:30,587
That's right!

1380
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:34,632
I suppose...

1381
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,801
What?

1382
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,805
I suppose I felt
detached from it.

1383
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,975
The way you are when you read
something in a newspaper...

1384
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:53,109
Detach yourself from that!

1385
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:59,908
We were the lucky ones!

1386
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:04,537
There's bodies buried back there!
Buried like dogs!

1387
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,836
Don't look at me.

1388
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:14,547
Turn your face away!
Don't look at me!

1389
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,680
No! Run!
Michael, run!

1390
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:23,181
I'll get Stanton, Father.

1391
01:33:28,104 --> 01:33:30,396
He reminds me of me.

1392
01:33:35,903 --> 01:33:37,988
It's not too late, Jack.

1393
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:41,242
Yes, it is.

1394
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:45,787
Yes, it is.

1395
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,041
Say your prayers, Father.

1396
01:33:52,002 --> 01:33:54,003
I've already said them.
